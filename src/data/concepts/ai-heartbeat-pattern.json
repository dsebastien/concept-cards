    "name": "AI Heartbeat Pattern",
    "summary": "Design pattern where AI agents periodically wake up at configured intervals to check for changes, tasks, or events rather than waiting for explicit invocation.",
    "explanation": "The AI Heartbeat Pattern is an architectural approach for proactive AI systems where agents operate on a periodic schedule rather than purely responding to user commands. Like a biological heartbeat, the AI \"wakes up\" at regular intervals to:\n\n- **Scan for changes**: Check files, databases, or systems for modifications since the last heartbeat\n- **Process queued tasks**: Look for pending requests or to-do items\n- **Monitor conditions**: Evaluate triggers, thresholds, or events that require action\n- **Update state**: Refresh context and maintain awareness of the current situation\n\nKey design considerations:\n\n**Interval configuration**: Heartbeat frequency balances responsiveness against resource usage. Common intervals range from 30 seconds (near real-time) to several minutes (batch processing). Some systems allow dynamic intervals that increase during inactivity.\n\n**Idempotent operations**: Since heartbeats may fire repeatedly, actions should be safe to repeat without side effects. The agent should track what has been processed.\n\n**Efficient diffing**: Rather than re-processing everything, smart heartbeat systems maintain state about what changed since the last check. Git commits, file modification timestamps, or database change logs enable efficient delta processing.\n\n**Graceful degradation**: If a heartbeat cycle fails, the system should recover on the next cycle without data loss or duplicate processing.\n\nThe pattern enables a fundamentally different interaction model: instead of \"ask and receive,\" users can simply express intent in their normal workflow (adding a task, writing a note) and trust that the AI will notice and act. This creates an ambient intelligence that feels like having a thoughtful assistant always monitoring your work.\n\nTrade-offs include higher resource consumption compared to purely reactive systems and potential latency between user action and AI response (bounded by heartbeat interval).",
