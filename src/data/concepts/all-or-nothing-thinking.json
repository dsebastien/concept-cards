    "summary": "Cognitive distortion of seeing situations in extreme black-and-white terms without recognizing middle ground.",
    "explanation": "All-or-nothing thinking (also called black-and-white thinking, polarized thinking, or splitting) is a cognitive distortion where situations, people, or outcomes are evaluated in extreme binary categories with no middle ground. Things are either perfect or terrible, success or failure, good or evil—with nothing in between.\n\nThis pattern manifests as: 'If I can't do it perfectly, why bother?' (perfectionism paralysis), 'One mistake means I'm a complete failure' (catastrophizing), 'They disagreed with me, so they must hate me' (relationship distortion), and 'I broke my diet once, so I might as well give up' (abstinence violation effect).\n\nAll-or-nothing thinking causes real harm: it amplifies negative emotions, creates unnecessary anxiety, damages relationships, prevents learning from partial successes, and leads to giving up when perfection isn't achievable. It's associated with depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and personality disorders.\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) addresses this distortion through: recognizing the pattern when it occurs, challenging extreme thoughts with evidence, finding the gray areas and middle ground, using percentage thinking ('70% successful' vs. 'failure'), and practicing self-compassion for imperfection.\n\nFor knowledge workers and creators, all-or-nothing thinking sabotages: iterative improvement (good enough shipped beats perfect never finished), learning from failure (partial success contains lessons), sustainable habits (one slip doesn't erase progress), and realistic self-assessment (you contain both strengths and weaknesses).",
