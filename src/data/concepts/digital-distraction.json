    "summary": "The technology-driven fragmentation of attention caused by notifications, social media, and constant connectivity.",
    "explanation": "Digital distraction refers to the pervasive fragmentation of attention caused by digital devices and platforms. Modern technology captures attention through notifications, infinite scrolling, variable reward mechanisms (like the unpredictable dopamine hits from social media likes), and always-on connectivity. These design patterns are rooted in the attention economy, where platforms compete for user engagement as their primary currency.\n\nResearch has shown that the mere presence of a smartphone, even when face-down and silenced, can reduce available cognitive capacity. This phenomenon, sometimes called \"brain drain,\" demonstrates how deeply digital devices have become intertwined with our attention systems. Every notification, even when ignored, creates attention residue that lingers and degrades focus on the primary task.\n\nApps and platforms are deliberately designed using persuasion techniques to maximize time-on-device. Features like pull-to-refresh, autoplay, streak counters, and notification badges exploit psychological vulnerabilities to keep users engaged. Understanding these design patterns is the first step toward reclaiming attention.\n\nStrategies for managing digital distraction include notification management (turning off non-essential alerts), setting app time limits, practicing digital minimalism, establishing phone-free zones and times, using grayscale mode to reduce visual appeal, and batching digital communication into designated windows rather than responding in real-time. The goal is not to eliminate technology but to use it intentionally rather than reactively.",
