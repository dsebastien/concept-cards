    "name": "Agency",
    "summary": "The capacity to act independently and make free choices, exerting intentional influence over one's circumstances and environment.",
    "explanation": "Agency is the ability to take purposeful action and make choices that shape one's life and circumstances. It encompasses both the capacity to act and the sense of being the author of one's actions—feeling that you are the cause of events rather than merely subject to them.\n\n**Dimensions of Agency**:\n\n1. **Personal agency**: Control over your own thoughts, emotions, and behaviors\n2. **Proxy agency**: Influencing others who can act on your behalf\n3. **Collective agency**: Shared belief in a group's ability to achieve goals together\n\n**Psychological Foundations**:\n\nAgency is central to several psychological theories:\n\n- **Self-efficacy** (Bandura): Belief in your ability to succeed at specific tasks\n- **Locus of control** (Rotter): Whether you attribute outcomes to internal (your actions) or external (fate, others) factors\n- **Self-determination theory**: Autonomy as a basic psychological need\n- **Learned helplessness**: What happens when agency is repeatedly thwarted\n\n**Agency vs. Structure**:\n\nA fundamental tension exists between individual agency and structural constraints (social, economic, political forces). Neither extreme is accurate—we are neither completely free agents nor entirely determined by circumstances. Understanding this interplay helps navigate what you can change versus what requires collective action or acceptance.\n\n**Building Agency**:\n\n- Start with small wins to build self-efficacy\n- Develop skills that expand your options\n- Cultivate an internal locus of control\n- Build relationships (proxy agency)\n- Join communities working toward shared goals (collective agency)\n- Question learned helplessness patterns\n\n**Agency in Knowledge Work**:\n\nIn personal knowledge management, agency manifests as:\n\n- Actively choosing what to learn rather than passively consuming\n- Creating and connecting ideas rather than just collecting\n- Shaping your tools and systems to fit your needs\n- Taking ownership of your intellectual development\n\nHigh agency individuals don't wait for perfect conditions—they work with what they have while actively improving their situation.",
