    "summary": "The validation that your solution actually solves a real problem that people have and care about.",
    "explanation": "Problem-Solution Fit is the first critical milestone in building products, services, or expertise. It validates that you've identified a real problem worth solving and that your solution actually addresses it. It precedes Product-Market Fit.\n\n**The Two Validations:**\n1. **Problem validation:** Do people actually have this problem? Do they care enough to seek solutions?\n2. **Solution validation:** Does your solution actually solve the problem? Do people prefer it over alternatives?\n\n**Signs of Problem-Solution Fit:**\n- People actively search for solutions to the problem\n- They've tried other solutions (showing they care)\n- They can articulate their frustration clearly\n- They respond positively to your solution concept\n- Early users report the problem is genuinely solved\n\n**Signs You Don't Have It:**\n- You have to convince people they have the problem\n- People say 'nice to have' instead of 'must have'\n- Users try once and don't return\n- No one will pay (even a small amount)\n- Feedback is polite but not enthusiastic\n\n**The Validation Process:**\n1. **Identify assumed problem** - What problem do you think exists?\n2. **Talk to potential users** - Do they confirm the problem?\n3. **Understand current solutions** - What do they do now?\n4. **Propose your solution** - Does it resonate?\n5. **Test with real usage** - Does it actually solve their problem?\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n- Building solutions to problems you have, not customers have\n- Solving problems people don't care enough about\n- Assuming 'better' means people will switch\n- Skipping validation because you're certain\n\n**Relationship to Other Fits:**\n- **Problem-Solution Fit:** Does the solution work?\n- **Product-Market Fit:** Does the market want it at scale?\n- **Business Model Fit:** Can you deliver it profitably?",
