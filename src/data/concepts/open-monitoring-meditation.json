    "summary": "Meditation practice of non-reactive awareness of all experiences without focusing on any particular object.",
    "explanation": "Open Monitoring Meditation (also called choiceless awareness or open awareness) is a meditation style where attention is open to all experiences - thoughts, emotions, sensations, sounds - without selecting any particular focus. Rather than concentrating on an object like the breath, you maintain broad, receptive awareness of whatever arises.\n\nHow to practice Open Monitoring:\n\n1. Sit comfortably with eyes closed or softly focused\n2. Allow attention to be open and receptive\n3. Notice whatever arises - thoughts, sounds, sensations, emotions\n4. Observe without engaging, judging, or trying to change anything\n5. When you catch yourself lost in thought, return to open awareness\n6. Maintain a witnessing perspective on all experience\n\nKey qualities:\n- Non-selective attention (not focused on one object)\n- Non-reactive observation (noticing without engaging)\n- Equanimity (equal acceptance of all experiences)\n- Meta-awareness (aware of being aware)\n\nDifference from Focused Attention Meditation: Focused attention (like breath meditation) narrows attention to one object. Open monitoring expands attention to include everything. Many traditions teach focused attention first to stabilize the mind, then introduce open monitoring.\n\nBenefits: Develops metacognition (awareness of thought processes), reduces reactivity to emotions, increases cognitive flexibility, enhances creativity and insight, builds equanimity.\n\nTraditions using Open Monitoring: Vipassana (Mahasi noting technique), Zen Shikantaza (\"just sitting\"), Dzogchen (open presence), MBSR (choiceless awareness phase).\n\nChallenges: Can be difficult for beginners who get lost in thought without an anchor. Usually best learned after establishing some focused attention practice.",
