    "summary": "Hemingway's writing principle that deeper meaning should be implicit beneath the surface of a story.",
    "explanation": "The Iceberg Theory (also called the theory of omission) is a writing style developed by Ernest Hemingway in which the underlying meaning of a narrative is not explicitly stated but implied through surface-level details, dialogue, and action. Like an iceberg, only the tip is visible while the bulk of the meaning lies beneath the surface.\n\nHemingway described it in 'Death in the Afternoon' (1932): if a writer knows enough about what he is writing about, he may omit things that he knows. The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. The theory argues that deliberately omitting information, when the writer truly understands it, makes the writing stronger rather than weaker.\n\nThe approach works through several mechanisms. First, it trusts the reader's intelligence to infer meaning from carefully chosen details. Second, it creates subtext - the gap between what is said and what is meant, which engages the reader actively. Third, omission creates tension and resonance, as readers sense there is more beneath the surface. Fourth, it produces the distinctive spare, clean prose style that Hemingway became famous for.\n\nPractical applications of the iceberg theory include: using concrete details and actions instead of explanations of emotion, letting dialogue carry meaning without authorial commentary, implying backstory through behavior rather than exposition, and cutting everything that does not directly contribute to the effect you want to create.\n\nThe theory connects to broader principles beyond literary fiction. In communication, the most powerful messages often leave room for the audience to complete the meaning. In design, minimalism achieves impact through what is removed, not what is added. In leadership, actions communicate more than words. In teaching, guiding students to discover insights is more powerful than stating conclusions.\n\nThe iceberg theory's limitation is that it requires genuine depth of knowledge. If the writer omits because they do not know, not because they choose restraint, the result is shallow rather than deep. The power comes from knowing far more than you show.",
