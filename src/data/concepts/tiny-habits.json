    "summary": "A behavior change method by BJ Fogg that creates lasting habits by starting with extremely small behaviors anchored to existing routines, combined with immediate celebration.",
    "explanation": "Tiny Habits is a behavior change methodology developed by BJ Fogg, founder of Stanford's Behavior Design Lab and creator of the Fogg Behavior Model. The core insight is that lasting behavior change doesn't require motivation or willpower—it requires starting so small that the behavior is nearly impossible to fail.\n\nThe method has three components: Anchor, Behavior, and Celebration. First, you attach the new behavior to an existing routine (the anchor). Second, you make the new behavior tiny—under 30 seconds, so small you can't fail. Third, you celebrate immediately with genuine positive emotion. The formula is: 'After I [ANCHOR], I will [TINY BEHAVIOR]. Then I celebrate!'\n\nFor example, instead of committing to 'exercise 30 minutes daily,' you start with 'do 2 pushups after I pee.' The tiny behavior establishes the habit; scaling up comes naturally once the automatic trigger is wired. Other examples include flossing one tooth after brushing, writing one sentence after morning coffee, or taking three breaths after sitting at your desk.\n\nFogg emphasizes that feeling good is what wires habits into the brain, not repetition alone. The celebration—a brief moment of genuine positive emotion like saying 'I'm awesome!' or doing a fist pump—is the key mechanism for habit formation. This approach has been tested with over 40,000 people in Fogg's programs.\n\nTiny Habits' distinctive contribution is its focus on celebration and making behaviors so small that ability barriers disappear. Unlike approaches that rely on willpower or motivation, Tiny Habits leverages the brain's reward system to build automatic behaviors that grow naturally over time.",
