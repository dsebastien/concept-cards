    "summary": "The return on investment from marketing activities, measuring revenue generated relative to costs.",
    "explanation": "Marketing ROI quantifies whether marketing spending generates profitable returns. Calculate it as: (Revenue from Marketing - Marketing Cost) ÷ Marketing Cost × 100. For example, spending $1,000 that generates $5,000 in revenue yields 400% ROI. Challenges include: attributing revenue to specific activities, accounting for delayed effects (brand building pays off later), and measuring non-revenue benefits (awareness, engagement). Different channels and campaigns have different ROI profiles—some pay off quickly, others build long-term value. For creators, tracking marketing ROI prevents vanity metrics ('lots of followers') while revealing what actually drives revenue. Even rough estimates help prioritize: focus on activities with proven returns while testing new approaches carefully.",
