    "summary": "The use of visual tools and spatial representations to organize, connect, and understand knowledge in ways that complement text-based approaches.",
    "explanation": "Visual Knowledge Management encompasses the techniques and tools that leverage visual and spatial representations to organize, explore, and understand knowledge. While text-based notes are the backbone of most knowledge management systems, visual approaches tap into the brain's powerful spatial reasoning capabilities to reveal patterns, relationships, and structures that are difficult to perceive in linear text.\n\nMind maps are one of the most accessible visual knowledge tools, allowing you to branch out from a central concept and explore related ideas in a radial structure. Concept maps go further by explicitly labeling the relationships between ideas, creating a network of meaning rather than a simple hierarchy. Both formats excel at capturing the non-linear way ideas actually connect in our minds.\n\nCanvas views, such as those offered by Obsidian Canvas and Excalidraw, provide freeform spatial workspaces where notes, images, links, and drawings can be arranged and connected freely. These tools enable a form of spatial thinking where the position, proximity, and visual grouping of elements carry meaning. You can lay out a project, map a complex argument, or visually cluster related ideas in ways that would be impossible in a traditional document.\n\nKnowledge graphs and their visual exploration represent another powerful dimension of visual knowledge management. Graph views, like those found in tools such as Obsidian, render the connections between notes as an interactive network visualization. Exploring this graph can reveal unexpected clusters, orphaned notes, and structural patterns in your knowledge base that would otherwise remain hidden.\n\nSketchnoting bridges the gap between note-taking and visual thinking by combining handwritten text with simple drawings, icons, and visual structures during the capture process itself. This technique engages multiple cognitive channels simultaneously, improving both understanding and recall.\n\nThe key insight of visual knowledge management is that visual tools do not replace text-based PKM but rather complement it. The most effective knowledge systems use both modalities: text for precision and detail, and visual representations for overview, connection, and spatial understanding. By incorporating visual tools into your knowledge practice, you gain additional perspectives on your information and unlock modes of thinking that text alone cannot provide.",
