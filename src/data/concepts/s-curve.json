    "summary": "Model describing the typical sigmoid pattern of adoption, growth, or performance improvement over time.",
    "explanation": "The S-curve (or sigmoid curve) is a mathematical model that describes how many natural and social phenomena evolve over time. The pattern shows slow initial growth, followed by rapid acceleration, then deceleration as a ceiling is approached. S-curves appear in: technology adoption (few early adopters, rapid mainstream growth, then saturation), skill development (slow start, rapid improvement, then plateau), organizational growth (startup phase, hypergrowth, then maturity), and product life cycles. Understanding S-curves helps predict: when current approaches will hit limits, when new technologies might displace established ones, and when to invest in the next growth curve. In technology, companies must 'jump' to new S-curves before current ones plateau. In personal development, recognizing you're on the flat part of an S-curve signals it's time to learn something new. Clayton Christensen applied S-curve thinking to explain why incumbents fail - they optimize for mature S-curves while disruptors start new ones.",
