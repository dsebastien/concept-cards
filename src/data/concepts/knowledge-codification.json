    "explanation": "## What Is Knowledge Codification?\n\nKnowledge codification is the process of transforming knowledge -- particularly tacit, experiential knowledge -- into explicit, structured formats that can be stored, retrieved, and shared independently of the person who originally held it. It is the bridge between individual expertise and organizational capability.\n\n## Forms of Codification\n\nKnowledge can be codified at different levels of formality:\n\n- **Informal**: notes, emails, chat messages, comments in code\n- **Semi-structured**: wikis, knowledge bases, FAQs, tagged collections\n- **Structured**: databases, taxonomies, ontologies, decision trees\n- **Highly formal**: algorithms, standard operating procedures, mathematical models\n\nThe appropriate level depends on the audience, the complexity of the knowledge, and how frequently it needs to be accessed.\n\n## The Codification Challenge\n\nNot all knowledge codifies equally well:\n\n- **Easily codified**: facts, procedures, rules, specifications\n- **Partially codifiable**: heuristics, guidelines, best practices, patterns\n- **Difficult to codify**: intuition, judgment, aesthetic sense, social skills\n\nThe SECI model describes codification primarily in the Externalization phase (tacit to explicit) and Combination phase (explicit to explicit).\n\n## Strategies vs. Personalization\n\nHansen, Nohria, and Tierney identified two knowledge management strategies:\n\n- **Codification strategy**: invest in systems to capture and reuse documented knowledge (databases, repositories, templates)\n- **Personalization strategy**: invest in connecting people who hold knowledge (mentoring, communities of practice, social networks)\n\nMost organizations benefit from a blend, with emphasis depending on the nature of their work.\n\n## In PKM\n\nPersonal knowledge codification is the core activity of note-taking and knowledge management systems. Every time you write a note, create a concept map, or document a decision, you are codifying knowledge. Effective personal codification makes your future self (and collaborators) less dependent on memory and more capable of building on past insights.\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n- **Over-codification**: documenting everything creates noise that buries signal\n- **Under-codification**: relying on tribal knowledge and memory\n- **Stale codification**: documented knowledge that is never updated becomes misleading\n- **Codification without context**: capturing what was done without why it was done",
