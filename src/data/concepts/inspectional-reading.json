    "summary": "The second level of reading focused on systematic skimming and superficial reading to quickly grasp a book's structure, main arguments, and whether it deserves deeper reading.",
    "explanation": "Inspectional Reading is the second level of reading described by Mortimer Adler in 'How to Read a Book.' It aims to get the most out of a book within a limited time, helping you decide whether a book deserves more careful reading.\n\nThere are two types of inspectional reading: **Systematic Skimming (Pre-reading)** involves quickly surveying a book to determine its structure and main points. This includes reading the title and preface, studying the table of contents, checking the index for key terms, reading the publisher's blurb, glancing at chapters that seem pivotal, and flipping through pages reading paragraphs here and there. **Superficial Reading** means reading through the book quickly without stopping at difficult passages, getting a general sense before attempting deeper understanding.\n\nThe goal of inspectional reading is to answer: What kind of book is this? What is it about? What is the structure? These questions prepare you for analytical reading or help you decide the book isn't worth further investment.\n\nInspectional reading is a crucial skill for knowledge workers who face an overwhelming volume of potential reading material. Not every book deserves analytical reading, and inspectional reading helps you triage effectively. It's also the first step in tackling difficult books - sometimes you need to read through once superficially before you can understand it deeply.\n\nThis technique pairs well with progressive summarization and the Pareto principle applied to learning - extracting the key 20% of value efficiently.",
