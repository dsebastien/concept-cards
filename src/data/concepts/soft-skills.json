    "summary": "Interpersonal and social abilities that affect how people interact, communicate, and work together.",
    "explanation": "Soft skills are non-technical abilities related to how you work and interact with others. They include communication, emotional intelligence, leadership, teamwork, adaptability, problem-solving, time management, and conflict resolution. Unlike hard skills, they're difficult to quantify but increasingly recognized as critical for professional success.\n\nThese skills are sometimes called 'people skills,' 'interpersonal skills,' or 'essential skills.' They determine how effectively you apply your technical abilities in real-world contexts. A developer's code quality matters less if they can't collaborate with teammates, understand user needs, or explain technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.\n\nSoft skills are harder to teach and assess than hard skills, which is why traditional education often underemphasizes them. They're typically developed through experience, feedback, and deliberate practice in social situations. However, they're also more durable—the ability to communicate clearly, resolve conflicts, and lead teams remains valuable regardless of technological changes.\n\nResearch increasingly shows soft skills predict career success better than technical expertise alone. They become more important as careers progress: individual contributors need primarily hard skills, but managers and leaders rely heavily on soft skills. In the AI era, soft skills gain further importance as automation handles routine technical tasks, leaving distinctly human capabilities—creativity, empathy, complex communication—as key differentiators.",
