    "summary": "Writing content that is officially credited to another person.",
    "explanation": "Ghostwriting is the practice of writing content—books, articles, speeches, or other texts—that will be published under someone else's name. The ghostwriter remains anonymous while the credited author takes public ownership of the work.\n\n**Why ghostwriting exists:**\n\nMany people have valuable expertise, stories, or ideas but lack the time, skill, or inclination to write. Executives, celebrities, thought leaders, and busy professionals often hire ghostwriters to transform their knowledge into polished content. The ghostwriter's job is to capture the client's voice, ideas, and personality authentically.\n\n**The craft of ghostwriting:**\n\nEffective ghostwriters must:\n- Interview clients deeply to understand their voice and perspective\n- Research topics thoroughly to represent expertise accurately\n- Adapt their writing style to match the credited author\n- Remain invisible—the best ghostwritten work feels entirely authentic\n- Maintain confidentiality about the working relationship\n\n**Modern ghostwriting:**\n\nWith AI tools, the concept of ghostwriting has evolved. AI can now serve as a ghostwriter when properly trained on someone's voice, style, and knowledge. This democratizes ghostwriting—individuals can create their own AI ghostwriters to help scale content production while maintaining their authentic voice.\n\n**Ethical considerations:**\n\nGhostwriting is widely accepted in business, politics, and entertainment. However, it remains controversial in academia and scientific publishing, where authorship implies direct intellectual contribution.",
