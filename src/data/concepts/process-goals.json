    "name": "Process Goals",
    "summary": "Goals focused on executing specific behaviors and actions rather than achieving particular outcomes, giving you direct control over progress.",
    "explanation": "Process goals focus on the actions and behaviors you will perform, as opposed to outcome goals that focus on the results you want to achieve. While outcome goals define *where* you want to go, process goals define *how* you'll get there.\n\n## Process goals vs. outcome goals\n\n| Aspect | Process Goal | Outcome Goal |\n|---|---|---|\n| Focus | Actions and behaviors | Results and achievements |\n| Control | Fully within your control | Partially influenced by external factors |\n| Example | Write 1,000 words daily | Publish a bestselling book |\n| Example | Make 20 sales calls/week | Achieve $1M revenue |\n| Example | Exercise 30 min, 5 days/week | Lose 15 kg |\n| Measurement | Did you do it? (Yes/No) | Did you achieve it? (Often delayed) |\n| Feedback speed | Immediate | Delayed |\n\n## Why process goals are powerful\n\n1. **100% controllable** - You can't control whether your book becomes a bestseller, but you can control whether you write every day\n2. **Immediate feedback** - You know today whether you met your process goal\n3. **Build identity** - Repeated actions shape who you become ('I am a writer' vs. 'I want to write a book')\n4. **Reduce anxiety** - Focus on what you can do rather than worrying about outcomes\n5. **Compound over time** - Small daily actions accumulate into significant results\n\n## The hierarchy of goals\n\nEffective goal systems use all three levels:\n\n1. **Vision/Outcome goals** - The destination (what you want to achieve)\n2. **Performance goals** - Intermediate milestones (measurable progress markers)\n3. **Process goals** - Daily/weekly actions (what you actually do)\n\nExample:\n- Outcome: Run a sub-4-hour marathon\n- Performance: Run 10k in under 50 minutes by month 3\n- Process: Run 5 times per week, following the training plan\n\n## In practice\n\n### The 12 Week Year\nThe 12WY scoring system explicitly tracks process goals (tactics). Your weekly score measures whether you did the actions, not whether the outcomes materialized yet.\n\n### Atomic Habits\nJames Clear's identity-based habits align with process goals: focus on becoming the type of person who does the thing, not on the outcome.\n\n### Sports psychology\nElite athletes train with process goals (technique drills, practice routines) rather than outcome goals (win the championship), because process mastery produces outcomes.\n\n## Common mistake\n\nSetting only outcome goals without corresponding process goals. 'I want to lose weight' fails because it doesn't specify what to do. 'I will eat under 2,000 calories and walk 10,000 steps daily' succeeds because it's actionable today.",
