    "summary": "A sales methodology that focuses on customer pain points and positions products as solutions to specific problems.",
    "explanation": "Solution selling reframes sales conversations from 'what we sell' to 'what problems we solve.' Rather than listing product features, solution sellers diagnose customer pain points, quantify the cost of those problems, and position their offering as the remedy. The methodology involves identifying decision-makers, understanding their business challenges, developing a vision of a solution, and proving value through ROI analysis. Solution selling works best when customers have recognized problems but haven't determined how to solve them. For creators and knowledge workers, this means leading with the transformation you enable—the problem you solve—rather than the format or features of your offering.",
