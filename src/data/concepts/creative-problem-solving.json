    "explanation": "Creative Problem Solving (CPS) is a structured methodology developed by Alex Osborn and Sidney Parnes in the 1950s-60s. It provides a systematic framework for tackling complex problems by deliberately alternating between divergent thinking (generating options) and convergent thinking (evaluating and selecting).\n\nThe CPS Process has evolved over time, but core stages include:\n\n1. Clarify: Understand the challenge\n   - Divergent: Explore data, context, stakeholders\n   - Convergent: Define the problem statement\n\n2. Ideate: Generate ideas\n   - Divergent: Brainstorm many possible solutions\n   - Convergent: Select promising ideas for development\n\n3. Develop: Strengthen solutions\n   - Divergent: Explore ways to improve selected ideas\n   - Convergent: Formulate workable solutions\n\n4. Implement: Plan for action\n   - Divergent: Consider resources, obstacles, supporters\n   - Convergent: Create action plan\n\nKey principles of CPS:\n\n- Separate ideation from evaluation (defer judgment during divergent phases)\n- Strive for quantity (more ideas increase odds of finding good ones)\n- Seek wild ideas (unusual ideas can lead to breakthroughs)\n- Build on ideas (combine and improve rather than just generate)\n- Affirmative judgment (look for value in ideas before criticizing)\n\nCPS differs from unstructured creativity by providing a repeatable process. It differs from purely analytical problem-solving by incorporating creative generation phases.\n\nApplications: Product development, organizational challenges, strategic planning, personal decisions, and any situation requiring both innovation and practical implementation.",
