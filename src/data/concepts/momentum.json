    "summary": "The tendency for motion to continue and build upon itself, making consistent action progressively easier while inaction becomes harder to break.",
    "explanation": "Momentum is the principle that action begets action—once you start moving, continuing becomes easier, while stopping makes restarting progressively harder. This applies to physical motion, creative work, habits, and any form of sustained effort.\n\n**The Physics Metaphor**:\n\nLike a heavy object in motion, productivity has inertia. Getting started requires significant energy, but once moving, less effort is needed to maintain speed. Stopping means losing that accumulated energy and needing to overcome inertia again.\n\n**How Momentum Works**:\n\n1. **Resistance decreases**: Each action reduces friction for the next\n2. **Patterns strengthen**: Repetition builds neural pathways\n3. **Confidence grows**: Success creates belief in future success\n4. **Energy compounds**: Wins generate energy for more wins\n\n**Types of Momentum**:\n\n- **Creative momentum**: Regular creation makes creating easier\n- **Attention momentum**: Consistent publishing builds audience habits\n- **Learning momentum**: Daily practice accelerates skill acquisition\n- **Habit momentum**: Streaks become self-reinforcing\n\n**Building Momentum**:\n\n- **Start small**: Lower the activation energy needed\n- **Be consistent**: Regularity matters more than intensity\n- **Celebrate wins**: Acknowledge progress to fuel continuation\n- **Protect streaks**: Guard against momentum-breaking interruptions\n\n**Momentum Killers**:\n\n- **Extended breaks**: The longer the pause, the harder the restart\n- **Divided attention**: Switching between projects dissipates energy\n- **Negative feelings**: Emotions can act as brakes on forward motion\n- **Perfectionism**: Waiting for perfect conditions prevents starting\n\n**The Flywheel Effect**:\n\nMomentum creates a flywheel—initial pushes require great effort, but each push adds to stored energy. Eventually, the flywheel's own weight helps maintain rotation. The key is not stopping before the flywheel effect kicks in.\n\n**Key Insight**:\n\nMomentum is easier to maintain than to create. This makes consistency more valuable than occasional bursts of effort, and makes protecting existing momentum a priority.",
