    "summary": "A psychological state where people lose the capacity to envision better futures or imagine possibilities beyond their current circumstances.",
    "explanation": "The Inability to Dream describes a psychological condition where individuals or groups lose their capacity to envision better futures, imagine alternatives to current circumstances, or conceive of meaningful change. This isn't about literal dreams but about the aspirational imagination that drives human progress and personal growth.\n\nCauses:\n\n1. **Learned helplessness**: Repeated failures leading to belief that effort is futile\n2. **Survival mode**: When basic needs consume all cognitive resources\n3. **Trauma**: Past experiences creating protective cynicism\n4. **System overwhelm**: Complexity that makes change seem impossible\n5. **Cultural conditioning**: Environments that punish ambition or deviation\n\nSymptoms:\n\n- Inability to articulate goals or desires\n- Dismissing positive possibilities as 'unrealistic'\n- Living reactively rather than proactively\n- Difficulty engaging with 'what if' questions\n- Accepting current circumstances as permanent\n\nWhy it matters:\n\n- Dreams precede action - without vision, there's no motivation\n- Hope is essential for mental health and resilience\n- Innovation requires imagining what doesn't yet exist\n- Personal growth depends on seeing beyond current limitations\n\nRestoring the capacity to dream:\n\n- **Safety first**: Address immediate survival concerns\n- **Small wins**: Rebuild belief in agency through achievable goals\n- **Exposure**: Connect with people who model possibility\n- **Permission**: Create environments where dreaming is safe\n- **Practices**: Journaling, visualization, future self exercises\n\nThe inability to dream is often a protective response to disappointment, but it becomes its own prison.",
