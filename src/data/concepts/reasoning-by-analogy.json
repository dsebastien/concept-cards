    "name": "Reasoning by Analogy",
    "summary": "A thinking approach that solves problems by comparing them to similar situations and applying solutions that worked before.",
    "explanation": "Reasoning by analogy is one of the most common and efficient forms of human reasoning. It works by identifying similarities between a current situation and past experiences or known domains, then transferring knowledge or solutions from the familiar to the new context.\n\n**How It Works:**\n1. **Recognize similarity** - Notice that the current problem resembles something familiar\n2. **Map relationships** - Identify corresponding elements between domains\n3. **Transfer knowledge** - Apply insights, solutions, or predictions from the known to the unknown\n4. **Validate** - Check if the analogy holds and the transfer is appropriate\n\n**Advantages:**\n- **Efficiency:** Quick solutions without deriving everything from scratch\n- **Communication:** Analogies help explain complex ideas ('the brain is like a computer')\n- **Innovation:** Cross-domain analogies spark creative solutions\n- **Learning:** Connects new knowledge to existing understanding\n\n**Limitations:**\n- **Inherited assumptions:** Copies both good practices and bad ones\n- **False analogies:** Superficial similarities can mislead\n- **Bounded thinking:** Limits solutions to variations of what exists\n- **Missed opportunities:** May overlook fundamentally better approaches\n\n**Contrast with First Principles:**\nWhile first principles thinking questions all assumptions and builds from fundamentals, reasoning by analogy accepts existing frameworks and adapts them. Neither is universally better:\n- **Use analogy** for routine decisions, incremental improvements, and communication\n- **Use first principles** for breakthrough innovation, challenging industries, or when analogies keep failing\n\n**Examples:**\n- Designing a new product based on successful competitors\n- Applying management practices from one industry to another\n- Using biological systems to inspire engineering solutions (biomimicry)\n\nSkilled thinkers know when to reason from analogy (fast, efficient) and when to question assumptions with first principles (thorough, innovative).",
