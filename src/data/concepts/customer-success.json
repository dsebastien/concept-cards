    "summary": "A proactive approach ensuring customers achieve their desired outcomes while using your product.",
    "explanation": "Customer success shifts from reactive support (fixing problems when they arise) to proactive partnership (ensuring customers achieve their goals). Customer Success Managers (CSMs) monitor customer health, identify at-risk accounts, drive adoption, and maximize value realization. Key activities include: tracking usage patterns, conducting business reviews, identifying expansion opportunities, and advocating for customer needs internally. Success is measured by outcomes: customer retention, expansion revenue, and customer satisfaction. For creators and course providers, customer success means helping students actually complete courses and achieve transformations—not just making sales. When customers succeed, they renew, expand, and refer others.",
