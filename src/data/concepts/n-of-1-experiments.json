    "summary": "Self-experimentation methodology where you systematically test interventions on yourself to find what works for your unique biology and circumstances.",
    "explanation": "N-of-1 experiments (also called single-subject research or self-experiments) involve systematically testing interventions on yourself rather than relying solely on population-level research. The premise: what works on average may not work for you, and what works for you may not show up in averaged data. The methodology adapts scientific rigor to personal context. Key principles include: testing one variable at a time, establishing baselines before interventions, tracking relevant outcomes consistently, running experiments long enough to see real effects (not just noise), using control periods or crossover designs when possible, and being honest about results even when they contradict expectations. Common domains for self-experimentation: sleep (timing, duration, environment), nutrition (foods, timing, elimination diets), supplements and nootropics, exercise protocols, productivity systems, and habit interventions. Best practices: define clear hypotheses ('If I do X, I expect Y to change'), choose measurable outcomes, control for confounders where possible, document everything, and remain skeptical of early results. Risks include: confirmation bias, inadequate controls, health risks with medical interventions, and over-optimizing based on noise. The Quantified Self community has championed this approach, combining personal data collection with experimental mindset. For knowledge workers, N-of-1 experiments help discover your optimal conditions for focus, creativity, learning, and energy management.",
