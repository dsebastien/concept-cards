    "summary": "Processes for teams to reach decisions that leverage collective intelligence while avoiding pitfalls.",
    "explanation": "Group decision making involves processes for teams to make choices together, ideally combining diverse perspectives for better outcomes than individuals could achieve alone. Methods range from: consensus (everyone agrees), consent (no one objects), majority vote, advice process (decision-maker consults affected parties), and autocratic (leader decides). Each has tradeoffs: consensus is thorough but slow, voting is fast but can create winners/losers. Group decision making faces pitfalls: groupthink (conformity pressure), social loafing (diffused responsibility), dominance by vocal members, and anchoring on early suggestions. Countermeasures include: structured processes, anonymous input, devil's advocates, and clear decision-making protocols. Good group decisions require: clear decision rights (who decides), appropriate participation (who's consulted), explicit process (how we'll decide), and commitment mechanisms (ensuring follow-through). For knowledge workers, understanding group decision making helps: contribute effectively to team decisions and facilitate better outcomes.",
