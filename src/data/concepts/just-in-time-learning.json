    "explanation": "Just-in-Time Learning is the practice of acquiring knowledge exactly when you need it rather than studying in advance 'just in case.' Instead of front-loading learning, you learn on demand as needs arise. This approach is efficient (no wasted learning), relevant (immediate application), and motivating (clear purpose). PKM systems support just-in-time learning by providing quick access to reference material when needed. The key is knowing where to find information, not memorizing everything.",
