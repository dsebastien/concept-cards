  "name": "Comparative Advantage",
  "summary": "The ability to produce a good or service at a lower opportunity cost than others, enabling mutually beneficial specialization and trade.",
  "explanation": "Comparative advantage, introduced by economist David Ricardo, is one of the most important concepts in economics. It explains why specialization and trade benefit everyone, even when one party is better at everything.\n\nThe key insight: what matters isn't absolute ability but opportunity cost. Even if you're better at both Task A and Task B than someone else, you should focus on whichever task has the lower opportunity cost for you - the one where your advantage is greatest or disadvantage is smallest. The other party should do the reverse. Both benefit from this specialization and exchange.\n\nClassic example: A lawyer who types 100 words per minute might be faster than any secretary. But her time is worth $500/hour in legal work versus $50/hour typing. The opportunity cost of her typing is enormous. She has a comparative advantage in legal work; the secretary has a comparative advantage in typing, even though the lawyer is faster at both.\n\nComparative advantage explains: why countries trade (each specializes in what they produce at lowest opportunity cost), why delegation makes sense (even when you could do it better yourself), why teams benefit from specialization (matching tasks to lowest opportunity cost), and why trying to do everything yourself is usually suboptimal.\n\nPractical applications for knowledge workers: identify your highest-value activities (where you have strongest comparative advantage), delegate or automate tasks where others have comparative advantage over you, recognize that 'I can do it better' isn't sufficient reason to do it yourself, and focus time on activities with highest opportunity cost for others to do. Understanding comparative advantage transforms how you think about collaboration, delegation, and time allocation.",
