    "explanation": "A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that manages databases, providing an interface between users/applications and the data. It handles storage, retrieval, security, backup, and concurrent access to data, abstracting physical storage details so users can interact with data through high-level languages like SQL without understanding how data is stored on disk.\n\n**Core Functions**:\n\n- **Data storage management**: Efficiently store and organize data on disk\n- **Query processing**: Parse, optimize, and execute queries\n- **Transaction management**: Ensure ACID properties for data integrity\n- **Concurrency control**: Handle multiple simultaneous users safely\n- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and access control\n- **Backup and recovery**: Protect against data loss and corruption\n- **Data integrity**: Enforce constraints and relationships\n\n**Three-Schema Architecture**:\n\n1. **External level**: User views of the data (what users see)\n2. **Conceptual level**: Logical structure of the entire database\n3. **Internal level**: Physical storage details\n\n**Types of DBMS by Data Model**:\n\n- **Relational (RDBMS)**: Tables with rows and columns (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL)\n- **Document**: JSON/BSON documents (MongoDB, CouchDB)\n- **Key-Value**: Simple key-value pairs (Redis, DynamoDB)\n- **Graph**: Nodes and relationships (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune)\n- **Wide-Column**: Column families (Cassandra, HBase)\n- **Time-Series**: Optimized for time-stamped data (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)\n\n**Types by Architecture**:\n\n- **Centralized**: Single server (traditional)\n- **Distributed**: Data spread across multiple nodes\n- **Federated**: Unified view of multiple independent databases\n- **Cloud-native**: Designed for cloud deployment (Spanner, Aurora)\n\n**Types by Use Case**:\n\n- **OLTP**: Online Transaction Processing (fast writes, many users)\n- **OLAP**: Online Analytical Processing (complex queries, reporting)\n- **HTAP**: Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing\n\n**Key Concepts**:\n\n**Query Optimization**: The DBMS query optimizer chooses the most efficient execution plan by parsing queries, generating possible plans, estimating costs, and selecting the lowest-cost option.\n\n**Buffer Management**: Caches frequently accessed data in memory using page replacement policies (LRU, Clock), write-ahead logging (WAL), and dirty page management.\n\n**Concurrency Control**: Handles simultaneous access through pessimistic locking (lock before access), optimistic locking (check conflicts at commit), or MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control).\n\n**Recovery**: Restores data after failures using Write-Ahead Logging (WAL), checkpointing, and algorithms like ARIES.",
