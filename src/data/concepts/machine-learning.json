    "summary": "A subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.",
    "explanation": "Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Rather than following explicitly programmed rules, ML algorithms use statistical techniques to 'learn' from examples and improve their performance over time.\n\nThree Main Types:\n\n1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data, where the correct output is known. Examples include classification (spam detection, image recognition) and regression (price prediction, forecasting).\n\n2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data without predefined categories. Techniques include clustering (customer segmentation), dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.\n\n3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for its actions. Used in robotics, game playing (AlphaGo), and autonomous systems.\n\nKey Concepts:\n\n- Training Data: The examples used to teach the model\n- Features: Input variables the model uses to make predictions\n- Model: The mathematical representation learned from data\n- Overfitting: When a model memorizes training data but fails to generalize\n- Validation: Testing model performance on unseen data\n\nCommon Algorithms:\n\n- Linear and Logistic Regression\n- Decision Trees and Random Forests\n- Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n- Neural Networks\n- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)\n- Gradient Boosting\n\nApplications:\n\n- Recommendation systems (Netflix, Spotify)\n- Natural language processing and translation\n- Computer vision and image recognition\n- Fraud detection and cybersecurity\n- Medical diagnosis and drug discovery\n- Autonomous vehicles\n- Predictive maintenance\n\nMachine learning has become foundational to modern AI applications, enabling systems to handle complex tasks that would be impractical to program explicitly. Deep learning, a subset of ML using neural networks with many layers, has driven recent breakthroughs in areas like language models and image generation.",
