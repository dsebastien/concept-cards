    "summary": "Unique capabilities that give a company competitive advantage and are difficult for competitors to replicate.",
    "explanation": "Core competencies, a concept introduced by C.K. Prahalad and Gary Hamel in 1990, are the collective learning and coordination skills that enable a company to deliver unique value to customers. A true core competency meets three criteria: it provides access to a wide variety of markets, makes a significant contribution to perceived customer benefits, and is difficult for competitors to imitate. Examples include Honda's expertise in engines (enabling cars, motorcycles, generators), Sony's miniaturization capabilities, and Apple's design and user experience excellence. Core competencies differ from competitive advantages in that they're deeply embedded organizational capabilities, not just market positions. Companies should focus resources on developing and leveraging core competencies while potentially outsourcing non-core activities. For knowledge workers, identifying your core competencies helps focus career development and find roles where your unique strengths create the most value.",
