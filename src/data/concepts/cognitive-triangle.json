    "summary": "A CBT model illustrating how thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected and influence each other.",
    "explanation": "The Cognitive Triangle is a fundamental concept in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) that illustrates the dynamic relationship between three components: thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Each element influences the others in a continuous cycle, meaning that changing one can lead to changes in the other two.\n\n## The Three Components\n\n**Thoughts (Cognitions)**: The internal dialogue, beliefs, and interpretations we have about ourselves, others, and situations. These can be automatic and often happen without conscious awareness.\n\n**Feelings (Emotions)**: The emotional responses we experience, such as anxiety, sadness, anger, or joy. These arise from our interpretation of events rather than the events themselves.\n\n**Behaviors (Actions)**: The actions we take in response to our thoughts and feelings. These can be overt (observable by others) or covert (internal, like avoidance).\n\n## How It Works\n\nConsider this example: You receive critical feedback at work.\n\n- **Thought**: \"I'm incompetent and will get fired.\"\n- **Feeling**: Anxiety, shame, fear\n- **Behavior**: Avoiding your manager, procrastinating on tasks\n\nThe behavior (avoidance) then reinforces the negative thought, creating a vicious cycle.\n\n## Therapeutic Application\n\nThe power of the cognitive triangle lies in its intervention points. Since changing any one component affects the others, therapists can help clients:\n\n1. **Challenge distorted thoughts** through cognitive restructuring\n2. **Regulate emotions** through mindfulness and acceptance\n3. **Modify behaviors** through behavioral experiments and exposure\n\nBy identifying which component is most accessible to change, individuals can break negative cycles and establish healthier patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting.",
