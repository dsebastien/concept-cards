    "name": "The Gap vs The Gain",
    "summary": "Measure progress by looking backward at gains rather than forward at the gap to ideals.",
    "explanation": "The Gap vs The Gain is a concept from Dan Sullivan and Benjamin Hardy's book of the same name. It describes two fundamentally different ways to measure progress and success.\n\n**The Gap (unhealthy measurement):**\n\nWhen measuring progress, we tend to compare our current situation against our ideal future. This creates \"The Gap\" — a distance that keeps growing as our ambitions expand. Like train tracks meeting at the horizon, you can chase it forever without feeling successful. The ideal is a moving target: as you grow, your standards and aspirations grow too. This leaves high achievers perpetually dissatisfied despite significant accomplishments.\n\n**The Gain (healthy measurement):**\n\nThe alternative is to measure backward: compare where you are now against where you started. This is \"The Gain.\" By focusing on actual progress made rather than remaining distance to an ever-moving ideal, you build confidence and motivation. You can see real, tangible improvements rather than chasing an abstract future.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\nThe Gap mindset creates chronic dissatisfaction, burnout, and imposter syndrome. You discount past achievements because they no longer seem impressive from your current vantage point. The Gain mindset builds gratitude, confidence, and momentum. Acknowledging real improvements naturally leads to practicing daily gratitude.\n\n**Application to journaling:**\n\nThis mindset shift is powerful for journaling. Instead of feeling shame about what you didn't accomplish today, you can recognize what you did achieve. The Gain perspective turns your journal into a record of victories rather than a list of shortcomings. Combined with periodic journaling, measuring backward provides the data you need to see trends and appreciate compound growth over time.\n\n**Key practices:**\n\n- At the end of each day, list three things you accomplished (not three things you failed to do)\n- During weekly reviews, note progress since last week rather than distance to quarterly goals\n- Celebrate milestones and wins, however small they seem in hindsight\n- Keep evidence of past achievements to combat the tendency to discount them",
