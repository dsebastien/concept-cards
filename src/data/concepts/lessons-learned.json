    "summary": "The practice of capturing knowledge gained from experience to improve future performance and avoid repeating mistakes.",
    "explanation": "Lessons learned is the practice of systematically identifying, documenting, and sharing knowledge gained from experience — both positive and negative — so that it can be applied to improve future performance. It transforms individual and team experiences into organizational knowledge.\n\n**The lessons learned process**:\n\n1. **Identification**: Recognizing insights during or after activities through retrospectives, after-action reviews, incident reports, or project reviews\n2. **Documentation**: Recording the context, what happened, why it matters, and the recommended action in a structured format\n3. **Validation**: Reviewing lessons to ensure they are accurate, relevant, and actionable\n4. **Dissemination**: Sharing lessons with those who need them through knowledge bases, briefings, training, or process updates\n5. **Application**: Integrating lessons into future planning, processes, and decision-making\n\n**What makes a good lesson learned**:\n\n- **Specific**: Clearly describes the situation and context\n- **Actionable**: Provides a concrete recommendation, not just an observation\n- **Transferable**: Written so others in different contexts can apply it\n- **Root-cause oriented**: Addresses underlying causes, not just symptoms\n\n**Common challenges**:\n\n- **Collection without application**: Organizations collect lessons but never use them\n- **Blame avoidance**: People withhold honest lessons to avoid looking bad\n- **Recency bias**: Only capturing lessons from failures, not successes\n- **Knowledge silos**: Lessons stay within the team that learned them\n- **Reinventing the wheel**: New teams or projects don't check for existing lessons\n\n**Lessons learned vs. related practices**:\n\n- **Retrospective**: A specific meeting format; lessons learned is the broader practice\n- **After-action review**: Military-origin review process; lessons learned captures the output\n- **Blameless postmortem**: Incident-specific review; lessons learned applies to all experiences\n- **Knowledge management**: Lessons learned is one input into the broader KM system\n\n**Making lessons learned effective**: The biggest challenge is not capturing lessons — it's ensuring they actually influence future behavior. The most effective organizations embed lessons into processes, checklists, training materials, and decision-making frameworks rather than storing them in databases nobody reads.",
