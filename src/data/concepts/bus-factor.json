    "summary": "The number of team members who would need to be unavailable before a project stalls.",
    "explanation": "Bus Factor measures knowledge concentration risk: how many people would need to be 'hit by a bus' before a project couldn't continue? A bus factor of 1 means a single person leaving would halt progress - a critical vulnerability. Increasing bus factor requires documentation, knowledge sharing, and cross-training. For personal knowledge work, consider your own bus factor: Is your knowledge accessible to future you or collaborators? Good PKM practices increase your personal bus factor by externalizing knowledge.",
