    "summary": "Systematic processes for screening and selecting relevant information while blocking noise.",
    "explanation": "Information filtering refers to the deliberate systems and habits that reduce information input to manageable, relevant streams. Unlike information triage (rapid sorting), filtering happens upstream - preventing unwanted information from reaching you at all. Effective filtering operates at multiple levels: technological (email rules, notification settings, ad blockers), environmental (physical workspace, device access), social (curated feeds, trusted sources), and cognitive (clear criteria for what matters). Good filters are: specific to your goals (not generic 'productivity' tips), regularly maintained (as needs change), and layered (multiple filters catch what single ones miss). The goal isn't zero information but optimal signal-to-noise ratio. For knowledge workers, building strong filters is essential because: willpower is finite (better to not see distractions than resist them), attention is the real scarce resource, and proactive filtering beats reactive ignoring.",
