    "summary": "A fundamental tradeoff in decision-making between trying new things to discover opportunities and using what you already know works.",
    "explanation": "A fundamental tradeoff in decision-making between:\n- **Exploration**: Trying new things, gathering information, discovering opportunities\n- **Exploitation**: Using what you already know works, optimizing known strategies\n\nToo much exploration leads to never capitalizing on what you learn. Too much exploitation leads to missing better opportunities and getting stuck in local optima.\n\nThe optimal balance depends on context:\n- **High exploration** when: starting out, environment is changing rapidly, time horizon is long, current results are poor\n- **High exploitation** when: time is limited, current approach works well, costs of experimentation are high\n\nThis tradeoff appears everywhere:\n- **Career choices**: stick with current job vs. explore new opportunities\n- **Learning**: deepen existing skills vs. acquire new ones\n- **Business**: optimize current products vs. innovate new ones\n- **Relationships**: invest in existing connections vs. meet new people\n\nThe New Now Next framework relates to this: \"new\" often represents exploration, while \"now\" and \"next\" involve exploitation of known paths.\n\nIn computer science, this is formalized in multi-armed bandit problems, where algorithms must balance gathering information about options (exploration) with maximizing rewards from known good options (exploitation).",
