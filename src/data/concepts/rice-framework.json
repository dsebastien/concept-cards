    "summary": "A prioritization framework scoring initiatives by Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort.",
    "explanation": "The RICE framework is a quantitative prioritization method developed by Intercom for product management. It scores initiatives using four factors to produce comparable priority scores.\n\n**The Four Factors:**\n\n1. **Reach**: How many users or customers will this affect in a given time period? Measured as a concrete number (e.g., 1000 users per quarter).\n\n2. **Impact**: How much will this affect each user? Scored on a scale: 3x (massive), 2x (high), 1x (medium), 0.5x (low), 0.25x (minimal).\n\n3. **Confidence**: How certain are you about your estimates? Expressed as a percentage: 100% (high confidence), 80% (medium), 50% (low). Lower confidence reduces the final score proportionally.\n\n4. **Effort**: How many person-months of work will this require? Higher effort reduces the score.\n\n**The Formula:**\n\nRICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n- Reduces subjective bias by requiring explicit estimates\n- Creates a common language for teams discussing priorities\n- Forces consideration of reach and impact, not just effort\n- Confidence factor accounts for uncertainty in estimates\n- Enables objective comparison across different types of initiatives\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n- Be consistent in how you measure reach (same time period, same units)\n- Document assumptions behind estimates for future calibration\n- Use the framework to inform decisions, not replace judgment entirely\n- Revisit and refine estimates as you learn more\n\nRICE is particularly valuable when comparing initiatives of different types or when teams have competing priorities that need objective evaluation.",
