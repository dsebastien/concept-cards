    "explanation": "Keyword research is the foundation of SEO—understanding what your audience actually searches for and how competitive those terms are. Key metrics include: search volume (monthly searches), keyword difficulty (competition level), and search intent (what searchers want). Types of keywords include: head terms (short, high volume, competitive like 'shoes'), long-tail keywords (longer, specific, less competitive like 'best running shoes for flat feet'), and question keywords (how, what, why queries). Tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, and Google Keyword Planner help identify opportunities. For creators, keyword research reveals: what questions your audience asks, what language they use, and content opportunities with achievable rankings. Effective keyword research balances volume (enough searches to matter) with achievability (you can actually rank).",
