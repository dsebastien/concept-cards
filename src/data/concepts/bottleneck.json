    "summary": "A point of congestion in a system that limits overall throughput, where capacity constraints restrict the flow of work or information.",
    "explanation": "A bottleneck is a constraint point in any system where limited capacity restricts overall throughput. The term comes from the narrow neck of a bottle, which limits how fast liquid can flow regardless of how much is in the bottle. In systems thinking, identifying and addressing bottlenecks is crucial for improving performance.\n\n**Characteristics of Bottlenecks**:\n\n1. **Rate limiting**: They determine the maximum throughput of the entire system\n2. **Queue formation**: Work accumulates before the bottleneck\n3. **Underutilization elsewhere**: Other parts of the system wait idle\n4. **Leverage point**: Improving the bottleneck improves the whole system\n\n**Types of Bottlenecks**:\n\n- **Resource bottlenecks**: Not enough capacity (people, machines, bandwidth)\n- **Process bottlenecks**: Slow steps or approvals in a workflow\n- **Knowledge bottlenecks**: Information or expertise concentrated in few people\n- **Decision bottlenecks**: Approvals required from limited decision-makers\n- **Technical bottlenecks**: System components that can't scale\n\n**Theory of Constraints (TOC)**:\n\nEliyahu Goldratt's framework for managing bottlenecks:\n\n1. **Identify**: Find the constraint limiting throughput\n2. **Exploit**: Maximize utilization of the constraint\n3. **Subordinate**: Align everything else to support the constraint\n4. **Elevate**: Invest to increase constraint capacity\n5. **Repeat**: Once resolved, a new constraint emerges\n\n**Common Organizational Bottlenecks**:\n\n- Founder/CEO who must approve everything (egotistical structure)\n- Single expert with unique knowledge (bus factor)\n- Shared resources with competing demands\n- Sequential processes that could be parallelized\n- Manual steps that could be automated\n\n**In Knowledge Work**:\n\nPersonal bottlenecks include:\n\n- Limited attention and energy\n- Single-threaded processing (you can only do one thing at a time)\n- Dependencies on others' availability\n- Tools that don't scale with your workflow\n\n**Addressing Bottlenecks**:\n\n- Increase capacity at the bottleneck\n- Reduce demand on the bottleneck\n- Parallelize or distribute work\n- Eliminate the bottleneck entirely\n- Accept it as a deliberate constraint\n\nNot all bottlenecks should be removed—sometimes they serve as useful governors. The key is intentionality: know where your bottlenecks are and make conscious choices about them.",
