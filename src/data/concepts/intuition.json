    "summary": "Rapid, automatic cognition that produces judgments without conscious deliberation, based on pattern recognition from accumulated experience.",
    "explanation": "Intuition is the ability to understand something immediately without conscious reasoning—the feeling of \"just knowing\" without knowing why. In Dual Process Theory, intuition corresponds to System 1: fast, effortless, pattern-based thinking.\n\nThe key insight is that intuition isn't magic—it's pattern recognition from accumulated expertise. Chess masters \"intuit\" good moves because they've internalized thousands of patterns. Firefighters sense when a building is about to collapse based on subtle cues they've learned to recognize unconsciously.\n\nDaniel Kahneman and Gerd Gigerenzer have debated intuition's reliability. Kahneman emphasizes the biases and errors that intuitive thinking produces, while Gigerenzer argues that intuitions are often ecologically rational heuristics shaped by experience in specific environments.\n\nIntuition works well in high-feedback environments with clear patterns—domains like chess, sports, or firefighting where you get immediate feedback on your decisions. However, it fails with statistical problems, novel situations, or when cognitive biases distort pattern recognition. The wisdom lies in knowing when to trust your gut and when to engage deliberate, analytical thinking.",
