    "explanation": "A Time Timer is a visual timer that shows the passage of time as a shrinking colored disk, making abstract time concrete and visible. Unlike digital timers that just show numbers, the visual representation helps those with time blindness understand how much time remains at a glance. It's particularly useful for time-boxed work sessions, transitions between tasks, and maintaining focus. The visual cue creates gentle urgency without the stress of watching numbers count down, supporting techniques like Pomodoro and time-blocking.",
