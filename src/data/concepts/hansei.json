    "summary": "The Japanese practice of critical self-reflection to acknowledge mistakes, understand root causes, and commit to improvement.",
    "explanation": "Hansei is a central concept in Japanese culture and a key practice within the Toyota Production System. It means 'self-reflection' or 'introspection', but carries a deeper connotation than the English words suggest. Hansei implies acknowledging one's own mistakes and shortcomings with sincerity and committing to do better.\n\n## Core elements\n\n1. **Acknowledge the gap** - Recognize the difference between what happened and what should have happened\n2. **Take responsibility** - Accept personal accountability without blaming others or circumstances\n3. **Understand root causes** - Reflect deeply on why the gap exists\n4. **Commit to action** - Make specific commitments to improve\n5. **Feel appropriate regret** - A genuine emotional response, not just intellectual analysis\n\n## Hansei in Toyota's culture\n\nAt Toyota, hansei is practiced at every level:\n\n- **Individual** - Workers reflect on their daily performance\n- **Team** - Groups conduct hansei meetings after projects or events\n- **Organizational** - Leadership models reflective practice publicly\n\nA key Toyota principle: 'No problem is a problem.' If you claim everything went perfectly, it means you aren't looking hard enough. There is always room for improvement.\n\n## Hansei vs. Western reflection\n\nWestern reflection tends to focus on what went well and what to improve. Hansei goes further:\n\n- It requires genuine emotional engagement, not just analysis\n- Even successful outcomes warrant hansei (what could have been even better?)\n- It emphasizes personal responsibility over systemic factors\n- The reflection must lead to concrete action, not just awareness\n\n## Hansei events\n\nA structured hansei session typically covers:\n\n1. What was the expected result?\n2. What was the actual result?\n3. Why is there a gap?\n4. What did we learn?\n5. What will we do differently?\n\nThis is closely related to the retrospective practice in agile development and the after-action review in military contexts.\n\n## Connection to improvement\n\nHansei creates the foundation for kaizen. Without honest self-reflection, there can be no genuine improvement. Hansei provides the awareness; kaizen provides the action.\n\nThe practice also builds psychological safety when done in groups - by normalizing the admission of mistakes, it creates an environment where people feel safe to surface problems early.",
