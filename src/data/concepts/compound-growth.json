    "summary": "Exponential growth where returns generate additional returns over time.",
    "explanation": "Compound Growth is the phenomenon where growth generates additional growth, creating exponential rather than linear progress over time. In finance, compound interest multiplies wealth; in knowledge, compound learning accelerates understanding. Your PKM system creates compounding value - each note and connection makes future learning easier, each insight enables new insights. This is why consistent, incremental progress over time produces remarkable results. PKM is a long-term investment that compounds.",
