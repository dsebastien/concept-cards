    "name": "Platform-Native Content",
    "summary": "Content specifically designed for a platform's unique format, culture, and algorithm rather than cross-posted generically.",
    "explanation": "Platform-Native Content is material created specifically for the platform where it will be published, respecting that platform's unique characteristics, audience expectations, and algorithmic preferences.\n\n**Why Native Matters:**\n- **Algorithm favor** - Platforms promote content that keeps users on-platform\n- **Audience expectations** - Each platform has cultural norms\n- **Format optimization** - Different platforms favor different formats\n- **Engagement** - Native content feels right; cross-posts feel lazy\n\n**Platform Characteristics:**\n\n**Twitter/X:**\n- Short, punchy, conversational\n- Threads for longer content\n- Hot takes and real-time commentary\n- Direct engagement valued\n\n**LinkedIn:**\n- Professional tone, career-focused\n- Story-driven, lesson-oriented\n- Longer posts perform well\n- Comments boost distribution\n\n**YouTube:**\n- Retention is king (watch time)\n- Thumbnails and titles critical\n- Pattern interrupts maintain attention\n- Call-to-actions for subscriptions\n\n**Instagram:**\n- Visual-first, aesthetic matters\n- Reels for reach, Stories for engagement\n- Carousels for education\n- Captions secondary to visuals\n\n**TikTok:**\n- Hook in first second\n- Trends and sounds drive discovery\n- Raw authenticity over polish\n- Entertainment first\n\n**Native vs. Repurposing:**\nRepurposing content across platforms works, but each piece should be adapted—not just copy-pasted. A Twitter thread shouldn't be screenshot-dumped on Instagram. Adapt the message to the medium.\n\n**The Investment:**\nNative content takes more effort but dramatically outperforms generic cross-posts. Focus on fewer platforms done well rather than many done poorly.",
