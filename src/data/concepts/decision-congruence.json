    "name": "Decision Congruence",
    "summary": "The principle that no choice is inherently the best, but any choice becomes the best when you fully commit to it and align your identity, energy, and actions around it.",
    "explanation": "Decision congruence is the idea that the quality of a decision is determined less by which option you choose and more by how fully you commit to the option you chose. A choice becomes the 'right' choice when you make it congruent with your identity and invest your energy into making it work.\n\nThis principle challenges the common assumption that somewhere out there is an objectively 'best' choice waiting to be discovered through enough analysis. Instead, it suggests that:\n\n1. **You make the choice right, not choose the right option**: After deciding, you find proof to support your choice, dismiss evidence against it, and concentrate your energy around it.\n2. **Full commitment creates effectiveness**: By letting go of other options and their constant pull, you focus your resources and become more effective at executing your chosen path.\n3. **Identity alignment seals the deal**: Making the decision part of your identity ('I am someone who...') creates natural momentum and consistency.\n\nThe opposite of decision congruence is the **opportunity cost of indecision** — trying to keep all options open, which means never getting anywhere. Half-commitment to multiple paths produces worse outcomes than full commitment to any single path.\n\nDecision congruence is closely related to cognitive dissonance reduction: once you commit, your mind naturally adjusts your beliefs and perceptions to support the choice. Rather than seeing this as a bias to be corrected, it can be deliberately harnessed as a feature.\n\nThe practical implication is liberating: spend less time agonizing over which choice is 'correct' and more time committing fully to whatever you choose.",
