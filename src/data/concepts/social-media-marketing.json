    "explanation": "Social media marketing encompasses both organic content (posts, stories, engagement) and paid advertising on platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube. Effective social marketing requires: choosing platforms where your audience spends time, creating native content (not just repurposing), consistent posting cadence, genuine engagement (not just broadcasting), and measuring what matters. Each platform has distinct culture, formats, and algorithms. Success comes from providing value—entertaining, educating, or inspiring—not just promoting. For creators and knowledge workers, social media builds audience, demonstrates expertise, and creates distribution channels for content and offers. The key is focus: better to excel on one or two platforms than spread thin across many.",
