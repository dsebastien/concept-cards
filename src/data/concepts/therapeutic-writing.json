    "summary": "The use of writing as a tool for emotional processing, healing, and psychological well-being.",
    "explanation": "Therapeutic writing encompasses a range of practices that use the written word as a vehicle for emotional processing, self-understanding, and psychological healing. Forms include journaling, poetry therapy, narrative therapy exercises, unsent letters, and structured expressive writing prompts. Each approach offers a different entry point for engaging with inner experience through language.\n\nThe research foundation for therapeutic writing draws heavily on James Pennebaker's expressive writing studies, which demonstrated measurable health benefits from writing about emotionally significant experiences for as little as fifteen to twenty minutes over several consecutive days. The mechanisms of action include cognitive processing (organizing chaotic thoughts into coherent narratives), emotional regulation (creating distance from overwhelming feelings), and meaning-making (finding sense and purpose in difficult experiences).\n\nClinical applications range from adjunct therapy for trauma, grief, and chronic illness to standalone wellness practices for stress management and personal growth. An important distinction exists between therapeutic writing, which is self-directed and can be practiced independently, and writing therapy, which is facilitated by a trained therapist within a clinical framework. Both share the core insight that translating experience into words can transform how that experience is understood and integrated.",
