    "summary": "Decision time increases logarithmically with the number of choices available.",
    "explanation": "Hick's Law states that the time it takes to make a decision increases logarithmically as the number of choices increases. More options = slower decisions. In PKM, this means: too many folder options slows filing; too many tags creates choice paralysis; too many tools fragments attention. Hick's Law supports the case for simpler systems with fewer, well-defined options. Reduce choice where possible - have a default location for captures, standard templates, and clear criteria for organization.",
