    "summary": "A system where outputs are routed back as inputs, creating a cycle that either amplifies or stabilizes behavior.",
    "explanation": "A feedback loop is a circular process where the output of a system is fed back as input, influencing subsequent behavior. Feedback loops are fundamental to understanding how systems behave, grow, stabilize, or collapse.\n\n## Two types\n\n### Positive (reinforcing) feedback loops\n\nAmplify change - the output reinforces the input, creating exponential growth or decline:\n\n- **Compound interest** - More money earns more interest, which earns more interest\n- **Viral growth** - More users invite more users who invite more users\n- **Bank runs** - Fear of bank failure causes withdrawals, which causes failure\n- **Skill development** - Better skills lead to better results, which motivates more practice\n- **Technical debt** - More debt makes changes harder, which creates more shortcuts, which adds more debt\n\nPositive loops are powerful but unstable. Without limits, they produce exponential growth (bubbles) or exponential decline (death spirals).\n\n### Negative (balancing) feedback loops\n\nStabilize the system by counteracting change:\n\n- **Thermostat** - Temperature rises above setpoint, heater turns off; falls below, heater turns on\n- **Supply and demand** - High prices reduce demand, which reduces prices\n- **Code reviews** - Catch and correct quality issues before they compound\n- **Retrospectives** - Team identifies problems and adjusts process\n- **Homeostasis** - Body temperature, blood sugar, and other vital signs are regulated\n\nNegative loops maintain equilibrium and are the basis of self-regulation.\n\n## Feedback loops in practice\n\n### Software development\n- **CI/CD pipelines** - Automated tests give rapid feedback on code changes\n- **User analytics** - Usage data informs product decisions\n- **Sprint retrospectives** - Team reflects and adjusts process\n- **Error monitoring** - Alerts trigger investigation and fixes\n\n### Personal development\n- **Journaling** - Reflection creates awareness, which improves decisions\n- **Habit tracking** - Visibility of streaks motivates consistency\n- **Mentoring** - External perspective corrects blind spots\n\n## Key properties\n\n- **Delay** - The time between action and feedback. Shorter delays enable faster learning\n- **Strength** - How much the feedback affects the next cycle\n- **Visibility** - Whether participants can see the feedback clearly\n- **Noise** - How much irrelevant information obscures the signal\n\n## Why feedback loops matter\n\nMost complex behaviors in natural and artificial systems emerge from interacting feedback loops. Understanding them helps you:\n\n- Design better systems (add balancing loops to prevent runaway behavior)\n- Accelerate learning (shorten feedback delays)\n- Avoid vicious cycles (recognize reinforcing loops early)\n- Create virtuous cycles (design reinforcing loops deliberately)",
