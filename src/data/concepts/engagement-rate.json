    "summary": "A metric measuring the level of interaction and involvement users have with content.",
    "explanation": "Engagement rate measures how actively users interact with content, typically expressed as a percentage. It's one of the most important metrics in social media marketing, content marketing, and audience analysis because it indicates genuine interest rather than passive viewing.\n\n**Common calculations:**\n\n**By reach:**\nEngagement Rate = (Total Engagements / Reach) × 100\n\n**By followers:**\nEngagement Rate = (Total Engagements / Followers) × 100\n\n**By impressions:**\nEngagement Rate = (Total Engagements / Impressions) × 100\n\n**What counts as engagement:**\n\n- Likes/reactions\n- Comments\n- Shares/retweets\n- Saves/bookmarks\n- Clicks\n- Video views (varies by platform)\n- Replies\n- Profile visits\n\n**Platform-specific benchmarks:**\n\n- Instagram: 1-3% average, 3-6% good\n- Facebook: 0.5-1% average, 1-2% good\n- Twitter/X: 0.02-0.09% average\n- LinkedIn: 2% considered good\n- TikTok: 3-9% average (higher overall)\n\n**Factors affecting engagement:**\n\n1. **Content quality**: Value, relevance, originality\n2. **Timing**: When audience is active\n3. **Format**: Video often outperforms static\n4. **Call to action**: Prompting response\n5. **Audience relationship**: Trust and connection\n6. **Algorithm favorability**: Platform-specific factors\n\n**Why engagement rate matters:**\n\n- **Algorithm signal**: Higher engagement = more distribution\n- **Audience quality**: Engaged followers > passive followers\n- **Content feedback**: Shows what resonates\n- **Influencer evaluation**: True influence vs vanity metrics\n- **ROI indicator**: Predicts conversion potential\n\n**Improving engagement:**\n\n1. Ask questions and encourage discussion\n2. Respond to comments promptly\n3. Create saveable/shareable content\n4. Use interactive features (polls, quizzes)\n5. Post consistently at optimal times\n6. Show personality and authenticity\n7. Create content worth sharing\n\n**Engagement rate vs other metrics:**\n\n- High reach + low engagement = content isn't resonating\n- Low reach + high engagement = loyal but small audience\n- High engagement = algorithm boost, potential virality\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n- Varies significantly by platform\n- Follower count affects calculations\n- Doesn't distinguish engagement quality\n- Can be gamed (engagement pods)\n- Different calculation methods make comparison difficult\n\nEngagement rate is crucial for understanding content effectiveness and audience connection, making it a core KPI for social media and content strategies.",
