    "name": "Build in Public",
    "summary": "Openly sharing your creative process, progress, and challenges as you build products, businesses, or projects.",
    "explanation": "Build in Public is a content and business strategy where creators share their journey openly—the wins, losses, metrics, decisions, and lessons learned—as they build something. Rather than launching in stealth and revealing a polished result, builders share the messy middle.\n\n**Why Build in Public:**\n- **Accountability:** Public commitment increases follow-through\n- **Feedback:** Early input improves the final product\n- **Audience building:** The journey attracts interested followers\n- **Trust:** Transparency builds authentic connections\n- **Content:** The process becomes the content\n- **Network:** Attracts collaborators, customers, and opportunities\n\n**What to Share:**\n- Progress updates and milestones\n- Revenue, user numbers, metrics (with context)\n- Decisions and the reasoning behind them\n- Failures, pivots, and lessons learned\n- Behind-the-scenes of daily work\n- Tools, processes, and workflows\n\n**Platforms:**\n- Twitter/X for quick updates\n- Newsletters for deeper dives\n- YouTube/podcasts for long-form\n- Indie Hackers, Reddit for community feedback\n\n**Cautions:**\n- Don't share competitively sensitive information\n- Balance transparency with privacy\n- Avoid performative vulnerability\n- Focus on value, not just updates\n\n**The Mindset:**\nBuilding in public requires comfort with imperfection and vulnerability. You're not showing a highlight reel—you're documenting reality. This authenticity is what makes it compelling.\n\n**Related Movements:**\nConnects to the indie hacker movement, creator economy, and the shift toward authentic personal brands over corporate polish.",
