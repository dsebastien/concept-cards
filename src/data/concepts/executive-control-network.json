    "name": "Executive Control Network",
    "summary": "A brain network centered on the prefrontal cortex that activates during focused attention, working memory, and goal-directed tasks requiring cognitive control.",
    "explanation": "The Executive Control Network (ECN), also called the Central Executive Network or Frontoparietal Network, is a large-scale brain network that activates when you need to focus, plan, make decisions, or hold information in working memory. It is anchored in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the posterior parietal cortex, with connections to other regions involved in cognitive control.\n\n**What it does:**\n\nThe ECN supports goal-directed behavior by enabling:\n- **Focused attention**: Sustaining concentration on a task while filtering distractions\n- **Working memory**: Holding and manipulating information in mind\n- **Decision-making**: Evaluating options and selecting actions\n- **Task switching**: Flexibly shifting between different cognitive demands\n- **Error monitoring**: Detecting mistakes and adjusting behavior\n- **Inhibition**: Suppressing irrelevant responses or impulses\n\n**The Triple Network Model:**\n\nThe ECN operates as part of a triple network system alongside the Default Mode Network (DMN) and the Salience Network (SN). The DMN activates during rest, mind-wandering, and self-referential thought. The ECN activates during external task-focused processing. The Salience Network acts as a switch between the two, detecting relevant stimuli and determining which network should be active.\n\nIn healthy cognition, these networks dynamically alternate: the SN detects something important, suppresses the DMN, and activates the ECN for focused processing. When the task is complete, the SN allows the DMN to re-engage for rest and reflection.\n\n**Clinical Relevance:**\n\nDysfunction of the ECN is implicated in ADHD (difficulty sustaining focused attention), depression (impaired cognitive control over negative thoughts), schizophrenia (disorganized thinking), and age-related cognitive decline. Strengthening ECN function through practices like meditation, physical exercise, and deliberate focus training can improve cognitive performance and mental health.",
