    "summary": "Content that remains valuable and relevant long after publication, continuing to attract and serve audiences over time.",
    "explanation": "Evergreen content is material that stays fresh and relevant regardless of when someone discovers it. Unlike news or trend-based content that expires, evergreen content addresses timeless topics and continues delivering value for years.\n\n**Characteristics of Evergreen Content:**\n- **Timeless topics** - Addresses enduring questions and challenges\n- **Foundational knowledge** - Teaches fundamentals that don't change\n- **Consistent search demand** - People always search for it\n- **Minimal date sensitivity** - Avoids 'this year' or current references\n- **Updateable** - Can be refreshed without complete rewrites\n\n**Examples:**\n- 'How to write a good email' (evergreen)\n- 'Best email tools of 2024' (not evergreen)\n- 'Principles of effective communication' (evergreen)\n- 'New features in Slack update' (not evergreen)\n\n**Why Evergreen Matters:**\n- **Compounds over time** - Traffic grows as content ages and ranks\n- **Reduces content treadmill** - Less pressure to constantly produce\n- **Builds authority** - Becomes the definitive resource\n- **Higher ROI** - One piece works indefinitely\n\n**Creating Evergreen Content:**\n1. Choose timeless topics (principles, fundamentals, how-tos)\n2. Avoid date-specific references\n3. Go deep rather than wide\n4. Update periodically to maintain accuracy\n5. Build internal links to drive traffic\n\n**Balancing Evergreen and Timely:**\nA healthy content strategy includes both. Timely content captures current interest; evergreen content builds lasting assets. The ratio depends on your goals—more evergreen for long-term leverage, more timely for immediate engagement.",
