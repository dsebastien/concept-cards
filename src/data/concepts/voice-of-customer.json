    "summary": "The process of capturing customer expectations, preferences, and feedback systematically.",
    "explanation": "Voice of Customer (VoC) programs systematically collect, analyze, and act on customer feedback. Sources include: surveys (NPS, CSAT, CES), interviews, support tickets, social media, reviews, sales conversations, and behavioral data. VoC reveals: what customers want, what frustrates them, what they value, and how they talk about their needs (in their own words). This intelligence informs product development, marketing messages, support improvements, and strategic decisions. Effective VoC requires: multiple feedback channels, systematic analysis, cross-functional sharing, and closed-loop follow-up (acting on feedback and telling customers). For creators, VoC might mean: surveying students about desired topics, analyzing common questions, reading course reviews, or conducting customer interviews to understand transformations.",
