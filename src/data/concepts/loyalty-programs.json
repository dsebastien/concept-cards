    "explanation": "Loyalty programs reward customers for continued business, creating switching costs and encouraging repeat purchases. Types include: points systems (earn and redeem), tiered programs (more benefits at higher levels), cashback, exclusive access, and gamification. Effective programs offer: rewards customers actually value, achievable milestones, clear progress visibility, and emotional connection beyond transactions. Loyalty programs work best when they enhance genuine value rather than substituting for it—customers stay for the product, programs reinforce the relationship. For creators, loyalty might manifest as: member-only content, early access to new products, alumni discounts, or recognition in community. The goal is making customers feel valued and increasing lifetime value.",
