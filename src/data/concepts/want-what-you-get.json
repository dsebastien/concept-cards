    "summary": "A mindset shift from pursuing desires to appreciating and valuing what you already have.",
    "explanation": "Want What You Get is a wisdom principle that inverts the common pursuit of 'getting what you want' into cultivating appreciation for 'wanting what you get.' Rather than constantly chasing new desires, this approach focuses on finding satisfaction in present circumstances.\n\nThe psychology behind it:\n\n- **Hedonic adaptation**: We quickly adapt to new acquisitions, returning to baseline happiness\n- **Desire treadmill**: Fulfilled desires spawn new desires, never ending the pursuit\n- **Present blindness**: We undervalue what we have while overvaluing what we lack\n\nHow to practice:\n\n1. **Gratitude practice**: Regularly noting what you appreciate about current circumstances\n2. **Reframing**: Seeing current possessions/situations with fresh eyes\n3. **Savoring**: Fully experiencing and appreciating present moments\n4. **Negative visualization**: Imagining loss to appreciate current abundance\n\nThis isn't about abandoning ambition or goals, but about:\n\n- Finding fulfillment independent of external achievements\n- Reducing the gap between desires and satisfaction\n- Breaking the 'I'll be happy when...' pattern\n- Recognizing that 'enough' is a decision, not a destination\n\nRelated Stoic concepts:\n\n- **Amor fati**: Loving your fate as it unfolds\n- **Memento mori**: Remembering mortality to appreciate life\n- **Apatheia**: Freedom from destructive passions\n\nThe paradox is that those who master wanting what they get often end up getting more of what they truly want - because contentment creates space for clarity about genuine needs versus manufactured desires.",
