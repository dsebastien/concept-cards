    "summary": "A techno-optimist movement advocating for accelerating technological progress, particularly AI, to maximize human flourishing.",
    "explanation": "Effective Accelerationism (e/acc) is a contemporary movement that emerged around 2022-2023, advocating for the acceleration of technological development - particularly artificial intelligence - as the best path to human flourishing. It positions itself in opposition to AI safety concerns and 'decelerationist' approaches.\n\nCore tenets:\n\n1. **Techno-optimism**: Technology has consistently improved human welfare and will continue to do so\n2. **Progress imperative**: Slowing down innovation causes more harm than potential risks\n3. **Anti-precautionary**: Excessive caution and regulation stifle beneficial progress\n4. **Abundance mindset**: Technology can create post-scarcity conditions\n\nKey arguments:\n\n- The biggest risk is not developing technology fast enough\n- Regulatory capture benefits incumbents over innovators\n- Human ingenuity will solve problems as they arise\n- Energy abundance through technology is key to civilization's future\n\nCriticisms:\n\n- Dismisses legitimate safety concerns about advanced AI\n- May underestimate catastrophic and existential risks\n- Often associated with venture capital interests\n- Can become ideological rather than pragmatic\n\nProponents include figures in Silicon Valley tech culture who argue that the 'effective altruism' movement has become too focused on risk mitigation at the expense of progress.\n\nThe movement highlights genuine tensions between innovation speed, safety, and regulatory approaches to emerging technologies.",
