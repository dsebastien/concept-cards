    "explanation": "Weekly Notes are periodic notes created each week for review, reflection, and planning. They typically include: reviewing what happened during the week, evaluating progress on goals, identifying lessons learned, processing accumulated items, and planning the week ahead. Weekly notes bridge daily tactical notes and longer-term strategic reviews. They help maintain perspective that's easy to lose in daily work and enable knowledge rollover between periods.",
