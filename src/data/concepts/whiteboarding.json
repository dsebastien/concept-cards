    "summary": "Using whiteboards or digital equivalents for collaborative visual thinking and problem-solving.",
    "explanation": "Whiteboarding is the practice of using whiteboards (physical or digital) for collaborative thinking, brainstorming, planning, and problem-solving. The large, shared visual surface enables real-time collaboration and iteration that's difficult to achieve with individual screens or paper.\n\n**Why Whiteboarding Works**:\n- **Shared visibility**: Everyone sees the same thing simultaneously\n- **Easy iteration**: Ideas can be quickly added, modified, or erased\n- **Physical engagement**: Standing and drawing activates different thinking\n- **Non-linear exploration**: Ideas can be placed anywhere, reorganized freely\n- **Equality of contribution**: Visual space feels more democratic than documents\n\n**Common Whiteboarding Activities**:\n- **Brainstorming sessions**: Generating and capturing ideas\n- **System design**: Architecting technical solutions\n- **Process mapping**: Documenting workflows and procedures\n- **Sprint planning**: Organizing work in agile teams\n- **Problem decomposition**: Breaking down complex challenges\n- **Teaching and explaining**: Illustrating concepts in real-time\n\n**Digital Whiteboarding**:\nTools like Miro, FigJam, Excalidraw, and Obsidian Canvas bring whiteboarding to distributed teams. They add features like:\n- Infinite canvas space\n- Persistent storage and history\n- Templates and frameworks\n- Asynchronous collaboration\n- Integration with other tools\n\n**In PKM Context**:\nPersonal whiteboarding (physical or with tools like Obsidian Canvas) supports divergent thinking, visual planning, and connecting ideas across your knowledge base.",
