    "summary": "An end-of-day reflection and planning practice that helps maintain awareness of progress, capture loose ends, and prepare for the next day.",
    "explanation": "A daily review is the practice of dedicating time at the end of each day to reflect on what was accomplished, identify unfinished tasks, and plan for the following day. This habit creates a natural checkpoint that prevents important items from falling through the cracks and reduces the mental load of trying to remember everything.\n\nThe process typically involves reviewing completed tasks, noting wins and lessons learned, capturing any open loops or ideas that surfaced during the day, and setting priorities for tomorrow. Many practitioners combine this with a brief journaling practice to deepen self-awareness and track patterns over time.\n\nDavid Allen's Getting Things Done methodology emphasizes the importance of regular reviews, and the daily review serves as a lightweight version of the weekly review. By consistently closing out each day, you reduce anxiety about forgotten commitments, build a clearer picture of your progress, and create a sense of closure that supports better rest and recovery.\n\nThe daily review also supports continuous improvement by making it easier to spot recurring obstacles, adjust strategies, and celebrate small wins. When practiced consistently, it becomes a keystone habit that strengthens other productivity practices and helps maintain alignment between daily actions and longer-term goals.",
