    "summary": "Malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems",
    "explanation": "Malware, short for malicious software, is any program or code intentionally designed to harm computer systems, networks, or users. It represents one of the most significant threats in cybersecurity, with new variants emerging constantly as attackers develop increasingly sophisticated techniques.\n\nMalware operates through various mechanisms depending on its type. Some malware exploits software vulnerabilities to gain entry, while others rely on social engineering to trick users into installing them. Once inside a system, malware may steal data, encrypt files, spy on activities, hijack computing resources, or create backdoors for future access. Modern malware often combines multiple techniques and can evade detection by disguising itself or modifying its code.\n\nReal-world examples demonstrate malware's devastating potential. The WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 affected over 200,000 computers across 150 countries, crippling hospitals, businesses, and government agencies. The Stuxnet worm, discovered in 2010, was designed to sabotage Iranian nuclear facilities by causing centrifuges to malfunction while reporting normal operations to monitoring systems.\n\nProtection against malware requires a multi-layered approach. Keep all software updated to patch known vulnerabilities. Use reputable antivirus and anti-malware software with real-time protection. Practice safe browsing habits and be cautious with email attachments and downloads. Implement the principle of least privilege, giving users only the access they need. Maintain regular backups following the 3-2-1 rule to recover from infections. Finally, educate yourself and others about social engineering tactics that malware often exploits for initial access.",
