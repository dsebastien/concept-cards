    "summary": "The practice of publishing content on a regular, predictable schedule to build audience trust and algorithmic favor.",
    "explanation": "Content Consistency is the practice of maintaining a regular publishing cadence. It's often more important than content quality for building an audience, because consistency builds trust, trains algorithms, and develops creative habits.\n\n**Why Consistency Beats Sporadic Brilliance:**\n- **Audience expectations** - People return when they know when to expect you\n- **Algorithmic favor** - Platforms reward consistent publishers\n- **Skill development** - Regular practice improves quality over time\n- **Compound effects** - Small consistent efforts beat occasional big ones\n- **Habit formation** - Consistency becomes automatic\n\n**The Consistency Spectrum:**\n- Daily (Twitter, Instagram Stories)\n- Several times per week (YouTube, podcasts)\n- Weekly (newsletters, blogs)\n- Bi-weekly or monthly (longer-form content)\n\n**Finding Your Sustainable Cadence:**\n1. Start with what you can maintain indefinitely\n2. Better to do less consistently than more inconsistently\n3. Build systems that make consistency easier\n4. Batch create to buffer against disruptions\n5. Have a backlog for emergencies\n\n**The Consistency Trap:**\nConsistency without quality eventually fails. The goal is consistent AND good enough, improving over time. Don't sacrifice both quality and consistency—find the sustainable intersection.\n\n**Building Consistency:**\n- **Content batching** - Create multiple pieces at once\n- **Templates** - Reduce decision fatigue\n- **Systems** - Automate scheduling and publishing\n- **Accountability** - Public commitments increase follow-through\n- **Buffer content** - Pre-made pieces for busy periods",
