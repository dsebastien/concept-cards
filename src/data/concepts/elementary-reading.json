    "explanation": "Elementary Reading is the first and most basic level of reading described by Mortimer Adler in 'How to Read a Book.' It concerns the mechanics of reading itself - the ability to recognize individual words, understand sentences, and grasp the surface meaning of text.\n\nThis level answers the question: 'What does the sentence say?' It's the foundation upon which all higher levels of reading are built. Without competence at the elementary level, inspectional, analytical, and syntopical reading are impossible.\n\nElementary reading develops through four stages: **Reading readiness** (pre-school) involves physical, intellectual, and emotional readiness for learning to read. **Word mastery** (first grade) is learning to recognize words and decode text. **Vocabulary and context** (fourth grade) involves rapid progress in building vocabulary and reading with fluency. **Functional literacy** (eighth grade) achieves mature reading ability, preparing for higher levels.\n\nWhile most adults have mastered elementary reading, the concept is important for understanding the hierarchy of reading skills. Many people plateau at this level, reading without truly engaging in the higher-order thinking that analytical or syntopical reading requires. Understanding that reading has levels beyond basic comprehension is the first step toward becoming a more effective reader.\n\nElementary reading is also relevant for learning new languages, where adults must return to this foundational level before progressing to higher forms of reading in the new language.",
