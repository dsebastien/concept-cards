    "name": "Progress Over Perfection",
    "summary": "The mindset of prioritizing forward movement and continuous improvement over waiting for perfect conditions or outcomes.",
    "explanation": "Progress Over Perfection is a mindset that values incremental advancement over the pursuit of an ideal end state. It recognizes that progress itself—however small—is more valuable than the paralysis that comes from chasing perfection.\n\n**The Philosophy:**\nPerfection is a moving target that recedes as you approach it. Progress, however, compounds. Small steps forward accumulate into significant distance over time. The person who writes one imperfect page daily will have a book in a year; the perfectionist waiting for the 'right time' will have nothing.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n1. **Start before you're ready** - Readiness is a feeling, not a fact\n2. **Embrace iteration** - First drafts exist to be improved\n3. **Value learning** - Mistakes from action teach more than theoretical preparation\n4. **Celebrate small wins** - Progress motivates more progress\n5. **Accept impermanence** - Today's work can be revised tomorrow\n\n**Applications:**\n- **Creative work:** Write badly first, edit later\n- **Fitness:** Any workout beats no workout\n- **Learning:** Imperfect practice beats perfect theory\n- **Business:** Launch and iterate beats plan forever\n- **Personal growth:** Small daily improvements compound\n\n**The Trap of Perfectionism:**\nPerfectionism disguises fear of judgment as high standards. Progress Over Perfection reframes the goal: not to be perfect, but to be better than yesterday.\n\n**Mantras:**\n- 'Imperfect action beats perfect inaction'\n- 'You can't edit a blank page'\n- 'The best time to start was yesterday; the second best is now'\n\nThis mindset pairs with kaizen (continuous improvement), the growth mindset (abilities can develop), and bias for action (favor doing over analyzing).",
