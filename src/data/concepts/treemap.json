    "summary": "A data visualization technique that displays hierarchical data as nested rectangles, where each rectangle's area represents a quantitative value.",
    "explanation": "A treemap is a space-efficient visualization method invented by Ben Shneiderman in 1991 at the University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab. Originally developed to visualize disk space usage, treemaps display hierarchical data as a set of nested rectangles, making efficient use of screen space to show thousands of items simultaneously.\n\n**How Treemaps Work**:\n- **Area** encodes the primary quantitative value (file size, revenue, population)\n- **Nesting** represents hierarchy (folders contain files, categories contain items)\n- **Color** can encode a secondary dimension (growth rate, type, status)\n\n**Layout Algorithms**:\n\n| Algorithm | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| Slice-and-dice (1991) | Original algorithm; alternates horizontal/vertical divisions |\n| Squarified (2000) | Optimizes for square-like rectangles for better readability |\n| Strip (2001) | Hybrid approach balancing aspects of both methods |\n| Pivot-by-size (2002) | Maintains data ordering for predictable layouts |\n\n**Common Applications**:\n- **Disk analysis**: WinDirStat, GrandPerspective, Baobab\n- **Financial markets**: Stock market maps, portfolio visualization\n- **Business intelligence**: Sales by region/product, budget allocation\n- **Software engineering**: Code complexity, test coverage by module\n- **News visualization**: Newsmap (Google News visualization)\n\n**Advantages**:\n- Space-efficient: Displays thousands of items in limited space\n- Comparative: Easy to spot large/small items at a glance\n- Hierarchical: Shows structure and proportions simultaneously\n- Scalable: Works from dozens to millions of items\n\n**Limitations**:\n- Deep hierarchies become hard to read with many nesting levels\n- Small items are difficult to label or interact with\n- Comparing non-adjacent rectangles is challenging\n- Thin rectangles are harder to perceive than squares",
