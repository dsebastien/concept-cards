    "summary": "An unhealthy mindset of constant productivity that leads to burnout.",
    "explanation": "Always Be Working (ABW) is an unhealthy mindset and cultural pressure that glorifies constant productivity. People in this mode feel compelled to work at all times, often using work as an escape mechanism—escaping reality, fears (like fear of failure), or both. This approach is unsustainable because when there is no time for rest, the goal can only be burnout. ABW ignores the fundamental human need for recovery, leisure, and non-work activities. The over-scheduled life is not worth living. Breaking free from ABW requires conscious boundary-setting and valuing rest as essential, not optional.",
