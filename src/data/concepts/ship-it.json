    "summary": "A mindset and expression encouraging releasing software or work rather than endlessly refining it.",
    "explanation": "Ship It is both a mindset and common expression in software development that emphasizes releasing work rather than pursuing perfection indefinitely. The philosophy acknowledges that software is never truly 'done' and that real-world feedback is more valuable than theoretical improvements. Shipping early and often enables faster learning, user validation, and iterative improvement. The concept connects to lean startup methodology's build-measure-learn cycle and the agile principle of working software over comprehensive documentation. However, 'ship it' must be balanced with quality standards - shipping broken or harmful software defeats the purpose. The healthy interpretation means: (1) prefer progress over perfection, (2) real feedback beats speculation, (3) iteration is expected, (4) done is better than perfect. For knowledge workers, the ship it mindset combats perfectionism and encourages sharing ideas even when incomplete, trusting that refinement can happen through collaboration.",
