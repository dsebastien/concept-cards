    "summary": "Deep specialized knowledge in a particular field that enables better decision-making, pattern recognition, and problem identification.",
    "explanation": "Domain expertise refers to deep, specialized knowledge accumulated through extensive experience and study in a particular field. Unlike general intelligence or transferable skills, domain expertise provides: pattern recognition from seeing many similar situations, intuition about what will and won't work, understanding of unwritten rules and hidden constraints, networks of relationships and trust, and credibility with stakeholders. In entrepreneurship, domain expertise is crucial for navigating the idea maze—founders with deep knowledge of their market understand why previous attempts failed, which approaches are viable, and what's actually needed by customers. This creates founder-market fit. Domain expertise compounds over time through deliberate practice and feedback loops. The challenge is that expertise can also create blind spots—experts may dismiss novel approaches that violate their mental models. The best experts combine deep domain knowledge with openness to paradigm shifts. For knowledge workers, building domain expertise requires focused investment in a specific area rather than spreading attention too thin, while maintaining peripheral awareness of adjacent domains that might disrupt your field.",
