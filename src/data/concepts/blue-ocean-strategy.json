    "summary": "Creating uncontested market space rather than competing in crowded existing markets.",
    "explanation": "Blue Ocean Strategy, developed by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, contrasts 'blue oceans' (untapped market space) with 'red oceans' (bloody competitive markets). Instead of fighting for share in existing markets, blue ocean thinking creates new demand by making competition irrelevant. Key tools include the Strategy Canvas (visualizing competitive factors), the Four Actions Framework (eliminate, reduce, raise, create), and focusing on non-customers. Examples include Cirque du Soleil (reinventing circus), Nintendo Wii (casual gaming), and Southwest Airlines (competing with car travel). For creators and knowledge workers, blue ocean thinking means finding unique angles, underserved audiences, or novel combinations rather than copying successful competitors in crowded niches.",
