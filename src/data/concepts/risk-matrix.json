    "explanation": "A risk matrix (also called a probability-impact matrix or risk heat map) is a visual tool used to prioritize risks by plotting their likelihood of occurrence against their potential impact. It is one of the most widely used qualitative risk assessment tools across industries.\n\n**Structure**:\n\n- **X-axis**: Impact/consequence severity (typically 1-5: negligible, minor, moderate, major, catastrophic)\n- **Y-axis**: Likelihood/probability (typically 1-5: rare, unlikely, possible, likely, almost certain)\n- **Risk score**: Likelihood × Impact, often color-coded into zones\n\n**Color-coded risk zones**:\n\n- **Green (Low)**: Acceptable risks — monitor and review\n- **Yellow (Medium)**: Risks requiring active management and mitigation plans\n- **Orange (High)**: Significant risks requiring priority attention and senior management oversight\n- **Red (Critical)**: Unacceptable risks requiring immediate action and possible escalation\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n- Simple, visual communication of risk priorities\n- Enables quick comparison and prioritization\n- Facilitates discussion and consensus building\n- Accessible to non-specialists\n\n**Limitations**:\n\n- Subjective assessments can vary between individuals\n- Coarse granularity can group very different risks together\n- May not capture risk velocity (how quickly a risk materializes)\n- Cannot represent risk interdependencies\n- Can create a false sense of precision\n\n**Best practices**:\n\n- Define clear, consistent criteria for each scale level\n- Use calibrated examples to reduce subjective variation\n- Complement with quantitative analysis for critical risks\n- Review and recalibrate periodically\n- Consider risk velocity and interconnections separately",
