    "summary": "AI agents that autonomously plan, create, iterate on, and refine images through multi-step reasoning and tool use.",
    "explanation": "Agentic Image Generation represents the evolution from simple text-to-image prompting to autonomous AI agents that can plan, generate, evaluate, and iteratively refine visual content. Rather than producing a single image from a single prompt, agentic systems orchestrate multi-step workflows that may include analyzing requirements, selecting appropriate models, generating initial drafts, self-critiquing results, and refining outputs through multiple iterations.\n\n**How it differs from basic image generation:**\n\n- **Planning**: The agent analyzes the task and decomposes it into sub-goals (composition, style, subject, mood)\n- **Tool selection**: It chooses between generation models, editing tools, and post-processing techniques\n- **Self-evaluation**: It assesses its own output against criteria and identifies improvements\n- **Iteration**: It refines results through multiple rounds without human intervention\n- **Context awareness**: It considers the broader use case (social media post, product photo, illustration)\n\n**Capabilities of agentic image systems:**\n\n- Generating multiple variations and selecting the best\n- Combining multiple generation techniques (text-to-image, inpainting, style transfer)\n- Maintaining visual consistency across a series of images\n- Adapting style and composition to specific brand guidelines\n- Orchestrating complex scenes by generating and compositing elements\n\n**Applications:**\n\n- Automated product photography and marketing visuals\n- Dynamic content creation for social media\n- Game asset generation pipelines\n- Personalized illustration and design\n- Architectural visualization workflows\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n- Quality control and hallucination detection in visual outputs\n- Maintaining coherence across multi-step generation\n- Ethical concerns around autonomous creation of realistic imagery\n- Copyright and attribution in agent-generated works\n\nAgentic image generation is part of the broader trend toward AI agents that don't just respond to single prompts but autonomously pursue complex creative goals.",
