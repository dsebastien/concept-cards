  "summary": "An analytical approach that starts with the big picture and progressively decomposes it into smaller, more detailed components.",
  "explanation": "Top-down analysis is a problem-solving and analytical approach that begins with a high-level overview and systematically breaks it down into increasingly specific details. It moves from the general to the particular, from abstract to concrete.\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Start with the overall system, goal, or problem\n2. Identify major components or categories\n3. Break each component into sub-components\n4. Continue decomposing until reaching actionable or atomic elements\n\n**Applications:**\n\n**Software development**: Design the architecture first, then modules, then functions, then code. Top-down design creates a blueprint before implementation.\n\n**Business strategy**: Define company mission, then strategic objectives, then departmental goals, then individual tasks.\n\n**Writing**: Start with thesis, then main arguments, then supporting points, then paragraphs.\n\n**Problem-solving**: Understand the whole problem, identify major factors, then drill into specifics.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Maintains alignment with overall goals\n- Provides clear structure and organization\n- Easier to communicate and delegate\n- Prevents getting lost in details prematurely\n- Good for well-understood domains\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Requires sufficient understanding of the whole system\n- May miss important details or exceptions\n- Can impose structure that doesn't fit reality\n- Less effective for novel or poorly understood problems\n\nTop-down analysis works best in combination with bottom-up analysis—using both approaches provides complementary perspectives and more robust understanding.",
