    "summary": "Action, Context, Experience - a framework for structuring decisions and learning.",
    "explanation": "The ACE Framework structures decision-making and learning around three elements: Action (what you do), Context (the circumstances surrounding the action), and Experience (the outcome and what you learned). By documenting all three, you build a database of situated knowledge - understanding not just what works, but under what conditions and with what results. This is more valuable than abstract rules because it captures the nuance of real situations.",
