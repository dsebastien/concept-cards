    "summary": "Systematic preparation for leadership transitions to ensure organizational continuity.",
    "explanation": "Succession planning is the deliberate process of identifying and developing people who can fill key roles when current leaders depart. Effective succession planning: identifies critical positions, assesses current talent, develops high-potential individuals, creates development opportunities, and ensures smooth transitions. This differs from replacement planning (simply naming backups) because it focuses on development and readiness, not just identification. Benefits include: reduced disruption from departures, better leader development, increased retention (people see paths forward), and organizational resilience. Challenges include: unpredictable timing, resistance from current leaders, and difficulty assessing potential versus performance. Best practices include: starting early, providing stretch assignments, creating exposure opportunities, and having honest conversations about development needs. For knowledge workers, understanding succession planning helps: recognize development opportunities, position for advancement, and contribute to team continuity.",
