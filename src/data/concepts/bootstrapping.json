    "summary": "Building a business using personal finances and revenue rather than external funding.",
    "explanation": "Bootstrapping is the practice of starting and growing a business using only personal savings and operating revenue, without external investors or venture capital. As Arvid Kahl describes it: accomplishing the unlikely using as few resources as possible.\n\n**The Four Phases of Bootstrapping:**\n\n1. **Preparation**: Find an audience, identify their biggest problems, imagine a solution, and start selling before the product is fully built.\n\n2. **Survival**: Find repeatable ways to make money, work on the product, listen to customers, define and automate processes.\n\n3. **Stability**: Offer a stable and mature product, hire outside help when needed, build long-lasting customer relationships.\n\n4. **Growth**: Decide whether to keep running the business or sell it, and work toward removing yourself from day-to-day operations.\n\n**Why Bootstrapping:**\n\n- Pour your heart and soul into meaningful projects\n- Focus on practicality over perfectionism\n- Enjoy the emotional rewards of doing your own thing at your own pace\n- Achieve financial and creative freedom\n- Find depth, purpose, and meaning in your work\n- Maintain work-life balance on your own terms\n\n**Trade-offs:**\n\nBootstrapping requires saying no to non-essential things since resources are limited. You must prioritize actions and choices with the most impact. Growth is typically slower than funded companies, but you retain full ownership and control. The path is challenging - many bootstrappers describe it as the hardest thing they've worked on - but the freedom and autonomy make it worthwhile for those suited to it.",
