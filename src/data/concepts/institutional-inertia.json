    "name": "Institutional Inertia",
    "summary": "The tendency of organizations and institutions to resist change and continue operating according to established patterns, procedures, and power structures.",
    "explanation": "Institutional inertia is the resistance to change exhibited by organizations, bureaucracies, and institutions. Once established, institutions develop routines, cultures, power structures, and standard operating procedures that become self-reinforcing. The larger and older the institution, the stronger the inertia.\n\n**Why Institutions Resist Change:**\n\n- **Sunk costs**: Massive investments in existing infrastructure, training, and processes make change feel wasteful\n- **Specialization and routines**: Employees develop expertise and workflows optimized for current systems; change threatens their competence and comfort\n- **Power structures**: Those who benefit from current arrangements actively resist changes that might redistribute power, resources, or status\n- **Cultural norms**: 'The way we do things here' becomes deeply embedded and self-reinforcing through hiring, training, and socialization\n- **Risk aversion**: Change carries visible risks while the costs of inaction are often invisible or diffused over time\n- **Coordination costs**: In large organizations, even simple changes require aligning many departments, contracts, and stakeholders\n- **Regulatory capture**: Institutions often shape the rules that govern them, creating feedback loops that protect the status quo\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- **Education**: University structures largely resemble 19th-century models despite radical changes in knowledge, technology, and the economy\n- **Healthcare**: Medical institutions are notoriously slow to adopt evidence-based improvements, with research-to-practice gaps averaging 17 years\n- **Government**: Bureaucratic procedures designed for one era persist long after the problems they addressed have changed\n- **Corporations**: Kodak invented digital photography but couldn't overcome its own institutional commitment to film\n\n**Overcoming Institutional Inertia:**\n\n- **Burning platforms**: Crises that make the cost of inaction visible and urgent\n- **Skunkworks**: Small, autonomous teams operating outside normal institutional constraints\n- **Institutional entrepreneurship**: Change agents who navigate and reshape institutional structures from within\n- **Competitive pressure**: External threats from more adaptive organizations\n- **Leadership turnover**: New leaders who aren't invested in legacy decisions\n- **Modular change**: Changing one component at a time rather than attempting wholesale transformation\n\nUnderstanding institutional inertia is critical for anyone trying to drive change in organizations. It explains why good ideas often fail not on their merits but because the institution cannot absorb them.",
