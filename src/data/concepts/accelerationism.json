    "name": "Accelerationism",
    "summary": "A range of ideas advocating that capitalism or technology should be accelerated to precipitate radical social transformation.",
    "explanation": "Accelerationism is a controversial philosophical and political stance that advocates for accelerating existing systems (capitalism, technology, or both) rather than resisting them, with the belief that this acceleration will precipitate radical social change or transcendence.\n\nKey variants:\n\n**Left Accelerationism (L/Acc)**\n- Advocates accelerating capitalism to hasten its contradictions and collapse\n- Aims for post-capitalist automation and universal basic income\n- Thinkers: Nick Srnicek, Alex Williams\n\n**Right Accelerationism (R/Acc)**\n- Embraces capitalist and technological acceleration as ends in themselves\n- Associated with Nick Land and cyberpunk philosophy\n- Often intersects with transhumanist ideas\n\n**Effective Accelerationism (e/acc)**\n- Contemporary movement focused on accelerating technological progress\n- Particularly centered on AI development\n- Positions itself against AI safety 'decelerationism'\n\nCore ideas:\n\n1. Resistance to technological/capitalist change is futile\n2. Acceleration will produce transformative outcomes\n3. Traditional political action is insufficient\n4. The future emerges from intensification, not moderation\n\nCriticisms:\n\n- May justify harmful outcomes as 'necessary'\n- Underestimates risks of uncontrolled acceleration\n- Can be used to dismiss legitimate concerns\n- Deterministic view of technological progress\n\nAccelerationism raises important questions about agency, progress, and whether humans can or should control technological development.",
