    "summary": "The process of restoring physical, mental, and emotional resources depleted by work and stress.",
    "explanation": "Recovery is the process through which individuals restore the physical, psychological, and emotional resources depleted during work and daily stressors. It's not merely the absence of work but an active process essential for sustainable performance, well-being, and preventing burnout.\n\n**Types of recovery**:\n\n1. **Internal recovery**: Brief restorative episodes during work (micro-breaks, switching tasks, short walks)\n\n2. **External recovery**: Restoration outside work hours (evenings, weekends, vacations)\n\n3. **Psychological detachment**: Mentally disengaging from work-related thoughts\n\n**Key recovery experiences** (based on Sonnentag's research):\n\n- **Detachment**: Mentally switching off from work\n- **Relaxation**: Low-activation pleasant activities\n- **Mastery**: Challenging non-work activities that build competence\n- **Control**: Autonomy over how to spend recovery time\n\n**Why recovery matters**:\n- Replenishes depleted self-regulatory resources\n- Restores energy for sustained attention and decision-making\n- Prevents cumulative stress from building into chronic conditions\n- Maintains cognitive flexibility and creativity\n- Protects against burnout and health problems\n\n**Barriers to recovery**:\n- Technology blurring work-life boundaries\n- 'Always-on' work cultures\n- Guilt about not working\n- Poor sleep habits\n- Rumination about work problems\n\n**Effective recovery practices**:\n- Set clear boundaries for work end times\n- Engage in absorbing hobbies that require presence\n- Prioritize sleep quality and quantity\n- Regular physical exercise\n- Social connection outside work contexts\n- Nature exposure\n- Mindfulness and relaxation practices\n\nFor knowledge workers, intentional recovery is not a luxury but a performance strategy. Quality of recovery affects next-day engagement, creativity, and resilience more than quantity of time off.",
