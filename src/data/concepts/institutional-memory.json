    "summary": "The collective knowledge, experiences, and information preserved within an organization over time.",
    "explanation": "Institutional memory encompasses the accumulated knowledge, experiences, data, processes, and organizational wisdom that an institution retains over time. It includes both explicit knowledge (documented procedures, records, databases) and tacit knowledge (cultural norms, unwritten rules, historical context for decisions).\n\nStrong institutional memory allows organizations to: avoid repeating past mistakes, understand why current systems exist, maintain consistency in decision-making, onboard new members effectively, and build upon previous work rather than starting from scratch. Weak institutional memory leads to context rot, where organizations lose understanding of their own history and repeatedly solve problems that were already solved.\n\nInstitutional memory is threatened by: employee turnover (especially of long-tenured staff), organizational restructuring, technology migrations that lose historical data, poor documentation practices, and over-reliance on tribal knowledge. The 'forgetting curve' of organizations accelerates when institutional memory isn't actively maintained.\n\nTo preserve institutional memory: maintain comprehensive documentation, use knowledge management systems, create succession plans, conduct exit interviews to capture departing knowledge, preserve decision logs and historical context, foster mentorship programs, and build a culture that values documentation and knowledge sharing. Digital preservation (archives, wikis, version control) is essential for long-term organizational memory.",
