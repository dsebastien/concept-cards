    "summary": "Harm caused by the healer—when interventions intended to help actually make things worse, often by disrupting natural adaptive systems.",
    "explanation": "Iatrogenics (from Greek 'iatros' meaning healer) originally referred to harm caused by medical treatment, but Nassim Taleb extended the concept to describe any situation where well-intentioned intervention causes more harm than good.\n\n**Medical Origins**:\n\nHistorically, medical interventions often caused more harm than benefit:\n- Bloodletting weakened patients\n- Unsanitary surgery spread infection\n- Overmedication creates side effects worse than the disease\n\nModern examples:\n- Antibiotics creating resistant bacteria\n- Painkillers causing addiction\n- Unnecessary surgeries\n- Overtreatment of self-limiting conditions\n\n**Iatrogenics Beyond Medicine**:\n\n**Economic Policy**:\n- Bailouts creating moral hazard\n- Stimulus creating bubbles\n- Regulations with unintended consequences\n\n**Parenting**:\n- Overprotection creating fragile children\n- Solving all problems preventing growth\n- Helicopter parenting reducing resilience\n\n**Organizational**:\n- 'Help' that creates dependency\n- Consultants whose solutions cause new problems\n- Process improvements that add complexity\n\n**Technology**:\n- 'Improvements' that break working systems\n- Features that complicate simple tasks\n- Automation that removes human judgment\n\n**Why Iatrogenics Happens**:\n\n1. **Intervention bias**: We feel we must 'do something'\n2. **Complexity blindness**: We underestimate second-order effects\n3. **Fragility transfer**: We shift risk rather than eliminate it\n4. **Naive interventionism**: We assume we understand the system\n5. **Lack of skin in the game**: Interveners don't bear consequences\n\n**Via Negativa as Antidote**:\n\nOften the best intervention is removal, not addition:\n- Remove harmful foods rather than add supplements\n- Remove complexity rather than add process\n- Remove obstacles rather than add help\n\n**Questions to Prevent Iatrogenics**:\n\n- What's the cost of doing nothing?\n- What could go wrong with intervention?\n- Does the intervener bear consequences of failure?\n- Is the system already adapting on its own?\n- Am I treating symptoms or causes?\n\n**The First Rule**:\n\nPrimum non nocere—'First, do no harm.' Before intervening, ensure your help won't make things worse. Sometimes the best action is patient inaction.",
