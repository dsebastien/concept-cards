    "name": "Bounded Awareness",
    "summary": "The systematic failure to notice, seek out, or use information that is relevant and accessible but falls outside our focus of attention.",
    "explanation": "Bounded awareness refers to the predictable ways people fail to see or seek information that is readily available and relevant to their decisions. Unlike bounded rationality (limited processing capacity), bounded awareness concerns what information we even consider in the first place. We systematically overlook relevant data because of how we frame problems, what we focus attention on, and what we assume is relevant.\n\nKey manifestations include: (1) Inattentional blindness - failing to see obvious things outside our focus. (2) Change blindness - missing gradual or unexpected changes. (3) Focalism - overweighting what we're currently thinking about. (4) Bounded ethicality - failing to notice the ethical dimensions of decisions. (5) Motivated blindness - unconsciously avoiding information that threatens our interests or self-image.\n\nCauses of bounded awareness: (1) Attention is selective - we can't process everything. (2) Mental models filter what seems relevant. (3) Goals and incentives shape what we look for. (4) Expertise creates both insight and blind spots.\n\nStrategies to expand awareness: (1) Actively seek disconfirming evidence. (2) Consult people with different perspectives and incentives. (3) Use checklists and frameworks to ensure systematic consideration. (4) Create processes that surface information you might naturally overlook. (5) Periodically question your framing of problems.\n\nBounded awareness explains many failures in business, policy, and personal decisions - not because the information was hidden, but because it wasn't noticed despite being available.",
