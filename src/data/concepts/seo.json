    "explanation": "SEO is about being found when people search for solutions you provide. It encompasses three pillars: Technical SEO (site speed, mobile-friendliness, crawlability, structured data), On-page SEO (keyword optimization, content quality, meta tags, internal linking), and Off-page SEO (backlinks, domain authority, brand mentions). Modern SEO prioritizes user experience and content quality over keyword tricks—search engines reward pages that best answer searcher intent. Key metrics include rankings, organic traffic, click-through rate, and conversions from organic. For creators and knowledge workers, SEO determines whether your content reaches people actively searching for answers. It's a long-term investment—rankings compound over time as authority builds.",
