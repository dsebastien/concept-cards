    "summary": "The practice of writing in a clear, concise way that the intended audience can easily understand on first reading.",
    "explanation": "Plain language is a communication approach focused on writing so clearly that readers can find what they need, understand what they find, and use that information effectively. It is not about dumbing down content or avoiding complex ideas, but about presenting information in the most accessible and efficient way possible for the intended audience.\n\nThe core principles of plain language include using short sentences, preferring active voice over passive voice, choosing common words over jargon, organizing information logically, using headings and lists to aid scanning, and placing the most important information first. These principles are grounded in research on how people actually read and process written information - studies consistently show that concise, well-structured text leads to better comprehension, faster task completion, and fewer errors.\n\nThe plain language movement has gained significant institutional support. The United States Plain Writing Act of 2010 requires federal agencies to use plain language in public documents. Similar legislation and guidelines exist in many other countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and across the European Union. These mandates reflect a growing recognition that unclear writing creates real costs: wasted time, misunderstood instructions, legal disputes, and exclusion of people with lower literacy levels.\n\nPlain language has transformative applications across many fields. In legal writing, it replaces dense legalese with clear terms that clients and citizens can actually understand. In healthcare, it makes medical information accessible to patients, improving health outcomes and informed consent. In technical writing, it ensures that documentation serves its purpose of helping users accomplish tasks. In government communication, it strengthens democracy by making public information genuinely public.\n\nOne persistent misconception about plain language is that complexity signals expertise and intelligence. In reality, the ability to explain complex ideas simply is a hallmark of deep understanding. As the saying often attributed to Einstein suggests, if you cannot explain it simply, you do not understand it well enough. Jargon-heavy writing often obscures muddled thinking rather than demonstrating mastery.\n\nPlain language is not a rigid formula but a reader-centered philosophy. What counts as plain depends on the audience: a technical audience may be familiar with specialized terminology that would confuse a general reader. The key question is always whether the writing serves the reader's needs, not the writer's desire to sound impressive. This emphasis on audience awareness makes plain language both a writing technique and a mindset that prioritizes communication over self-expression.",
