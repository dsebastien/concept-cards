    "name": "Epistemic Humility",
    "summary": "The recognition that one's knowledge is always limited, incomplete, and potentially wrong, combined with the disposition to hold beliefs lightly and remain genuinely open to revision when presented with new evidence.",
    "explanation": "Epistemic humility is the intellectual virtue of recognizing the limits and fallibility of one's own knowledge. It involves acknowledging that:\n\n- Your understanding of any topic is necessarily incomplete\n- Your perspectives are shaped by your particular experiences, culture, and cognitive biases\n- You could be wrong about things you feel certain about\n- Other people's viewpoints may contain truth that yours misses\n\nThis concept is distinct from general humility or lack of confidence. An epistemically humble person can be highly knowledgeable and decisive while maintaining awareness that all knowledge is provisional.\n\nKey practices of epistemic humility:\n\n- **Hold beliefs lightly**: Treat beliefs as working hypotheses rather than fixed conclusions.\n- **Seek disconfirming evidence**: Actively look for information that challenges your current views, not just information that supports them.\n- **Say 'I don't know'**: Resist the cultural pressure to have an opinion on everything.\n- **Update readily**: When evidence contradicts a belief, change the belief rather than dismissing the evidence.\n- **Distinguish confidence from certainty**: You can act confidently on your best current understanding while remaining open to being wrong.\n\nDerek Sivers frames epistemic humility as the foundation for his entire 'Useful Not True' approach: once you recognize that most of what you believe is not objectively true but rather a perspective shaped by your particular vantage point, you gain the freedom to choose perspectives based on usefulness rather than defending them as truth.\n\nEpistemic humility is especially important in a world of information overload, where confident-sounding claims abound and the temptation to treat opinions as facts is constant.",
