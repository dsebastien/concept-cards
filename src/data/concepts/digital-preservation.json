    "summary": "The active management of digital content over time to ensure it remains accessible and usable for the long term.",
    "explanation": "Digital preservation encompasses the policies, strategies, and actions required to ensure that digital information remains accessible, usable, and authentic over extended periods of time - potentially decades or centuries. Unlike physical preservation, digital preservation must contend with rapidly changing technology, format obsolescence, and the fragility of digital storage media.\n\n**Core challenges**:\n\n- **Format obsolescence**: File formats become unsupported (WordPerfect, Flash, early image formats)\n- **Software obsolescence**: Applications needed to open files are discontinued\n- **Hardware obsolescence**: Storage media becomes unreadable (floppy disks, ZIP drives)\n- **Bit rot**: Physical degradation of storage media over time\n- **Link rot**: URLs and references becoming broken\n\n**Preservation strategies**:\n\n**Migration**: Converting content to new formats as technology changes\n- Requires ongoing effort and monitoring\n- May lose some fidelity or metadata\n- Example: Converting Word docs to PDF/A for archival\n\n**Emulation**: Running old software in simulated environments\n- Preserves original experience\n- Complex and resource-intensive\n- Used for software, games, interactive content\n\n**Normalization**: Converting diverse formats to a few standard ones upon ingest\n- Simplifies long-term management\n- May lose format-specific features\n\n**Digital preservation for PKM**:\n\n- **Use open, plain-text formats**: Markdown, plain text, and open standards (PNG, PDF/A) have better longevity than proprietary formats\n- **Avoid vendor lock-in**: Tools that use open formats ensure your notes survive the tool\n- **Document your system**: Future you (or your heirs) needs to understand your organization\n- **Regular format audits**: Periodically check that all files can still be opened\n- **Multiple copies in multiple formats**: Export important content to both original and preservation formats\n\n**Institutional frameworks**:\n\n- **OAIS (Open Archival Information System)**: ISO standard for archival systems\n- **PREMIS**: Metadata standard for digital preservation\n- **LOCKSS**: \"Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe\" - distributed preservation network\n\nDigital preservation is an ongoing process, not a one-time action. The goal isn't just to keep bits intact but to maintain the ability to render them meaningfully.",
