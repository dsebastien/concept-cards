    "explanation": "Risk tolerance is the degree of variability in outcomes that an entity is willing to withstand in pursuit of its objectives. While risk appetite is the broad, strategic statement about willingness to take risk, risk tolerance provides the specific, measurable boundaries within which risk-taking is acceptable.\n\n**Risk tolerance vs. risk appetite**:\n\n- **Risk appetite**: 'We are willing to accept moderate financial risk' (qualitative, strategic)\n- **Risk tolerance**: 'We will not accept more than a 5% decline in quarterly revenue' (quantitative, operational)\n\n**Factors influencing risk tolerance**:\n\n- Financial capacity to absorb losses\n- Time horizon for objectives\n- Experience and expertise in the domain\n- Regulatory and compliance requirements\n- Stakeholder expectations\n- Competitive environment\n- Personal psychological comfort with uncertainty\n\n**Setting risk tolerance levels**:\n\n- Define metrics for each key risk category\n- Establish acceptable ranges (green/amber/red thresholds)\n- Align with organizational risk appetite\n- Consider worst-case scenarios and stress tests\n- Review periodically as conditions change\n\n**Personal risk tolerance** also applies to individual decision-making in areas like investing, career choices, and life decisions. Understanding your own risk tolerance helps make decisions aligned with your values and comfort level rather than being swayed by external pressure or emotional reactions.",
