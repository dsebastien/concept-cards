    "summary": "A pragmatic approach to complex decisions through small sequential steps rather than comprehensive rational analysis.",
    "explanation": "Political scientist Charles Lindblom introduced this concept in 1959 as the science of muddling through. He argued that the rational-comprehensive model of decision-making, where you identify all options, evaluate every consequence, and select the optimal choice, is unrealistic for complex real-world problems. Instead, decision-makers typically consider only a few alternatives that differ marginally from the status quo, focus on a limited set of consequences, and adjust course through successive small steps. Each step is informed by feedback from the previous one. This approach works well for several reasons. Complex systems are unpredictable, so grand plans often fail. Small steps are reversible, reducing risk. Each iteration provides learning that improves subsequent choices. The approach also accommodates the reality that goals are often unclear or conflicting, and that agreement among stakeholders is easier to reach on small changes than on comprehensive reforms. Incrementalism is not a sign of weakness or indecision but a sophisticated strategy for navigating complexity and uncertainty. It connects closely to agile methodologies, lean startup thinking, and the bias for action.",
