    "summary": "Specific, multi-word search phrases with lower volume but higher conversion intent and less competition.",
    "explanation": "Long-tail keywords are longer, more specific search queries—'best running shoes for flat feet marathon training' versus 'running shoes.' While individual long-tail terms have lower search volume, collectively they represent the majority of searches. Benefits include: less competition (easier to rank), higher intent (specific queries indicate clearer needs), and better conversion rates (visitors know what they want). The 'long tail' concept (from Chris Anderson) shows that aggregate niche demand can exceed mass-market demand. For creators, long-tail keyword strategy means: targeting specific questions your audience asks, creating comprehensive content for narrow topics, and accumulating traffic across many lower-volume but achievable keywords rather than fighting for impossible high-volume terms.",
