    "summary": "Planning and preparation to ensure critical business functions continue during and after a disaster.",
    "explanation": "Business continuity encompasses the proactive planning and preparation that enables an organization to continue delivering products and services at acceptable predefined levels following a disruptive incident. While disaster recovery focuses on restoring IT systems, business continuity addresses the broader organizational capability to maintain essential functions.\n\n**Core elements of business continuity**:\n\n- **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**: Identifying critical functions and the impact of their disruption\n- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating threats and vulnerabilities to the organization\n- **Continuity Strategies**: Developing approaches to maintain operations during disruptions\n- **Plan Development**: Documenting procedures, roles, and resources needed\n- **Testing and Exercises**: Validating plans through drills and simulations\n- **Maintenance**: Keeping plans current as the organization evolves\n\n**Key metrics**:\n- **Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD)**: Longest acceptable outage for each function\n- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Target time to restore operations\n- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss\n\n**Business continuity vs. disaster recovery**:\nDisaster recovery is a subset of business continuity focused specifically on IT systems. Business continuity addresses the entire organization including people, processes, facilities, and technology.\n\n**Critical success factors**:\n- Executive sponsorship and organizational commitment\n- Cross-functional involvement in planning\n- Regular testing and plan updates\n- Employee awareness and training\n- Integration with overall risk management\n\n**Common threats addressed**:\n- Natural disasters and severe weather\n- Cyberattacks and technology failures\n- Supply chain disruptions\n- Pandemic and workforce unavailability\n- Facility damage or inaccessibility\n\nEffective business continuity management builds organizational resilience, protects reputation, and can provide competitive advantage during industry-wide disruptions.",
