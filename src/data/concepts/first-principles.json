    "summary": "A reasoning approach that breaks down complex problems to their most fundamental truths and rebuilds understanding from there.",
    "explanation": "First principles thinking is a powerful reasoning approach that strips away assumptions to identify the most fundamental truths about a problem, then builds understanding and solutions from that foundation. Rather than reasoning by analogy (copying what others do or what has worked before), first principles thinking asks: 'What do we know to be absolutely true? What are the basic elements?'\n\nThe method originates from philosophy, particularly Aristotle, who defined a first principle as 'the first basis from which a thing is known.' In modern usage, it was popularized by innovators like Elon Musk, who used it to challenge assumptions in industries like space travel and electric vehicles.\n\n**The Process:**\n1. **Identify assumptions** - List everything you believe about the problem\n2. **Break down to fundamentals** - Question each assumption until you reach undeniable truths\n3. **Create new solutions** - Build up from these fundamentals without being constrained by convention\n\n**Example:** Instead of assuming batteries are expensive because that's the market price, Musk asked: 'What are batteries made of? What do those raw materials cost?' This revealed the true cost floor and opportunities for innovation.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Escapes conventional thinking and inherited assumptions\n- Enables breakthrough innovations\n- Reveals hidden opportunities others miss\n- Creates deeper understanding of problems\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Time and energy intensive\n- Requires significant domain knowledge\n- Not always necessary for routine decisions\n\nFirst principles thinking pairs well with the Feynman Technique (explaining to verify understanding) and systems thinking (understanding how fundamentals interact).",
