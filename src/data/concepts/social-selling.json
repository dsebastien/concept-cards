    "summary": "Using social media platforms to find, connect with, and nurture sales prospects.",
    "explanation": "Social selling leverages platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, and others to build relationships that lead to sales. Unlike social media marketing (broadcasting to many), social selling is one-to-one relationship building. Key activities include: optimizing your profile as a resource, sharing valuable content that demonstrates expertise, engaging meaningfully with prospects' posts, using social listening to identify buying signals, and transitioning online relationships to business conversations. Social selling works because buyers research online before talking to salespeople—being visible and helpful positions you as a trusted resource. For creators, social selling means building genuine relationships that naturally lead to business rather than constantly promoting.",
