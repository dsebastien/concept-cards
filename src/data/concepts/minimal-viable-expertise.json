    "summary": "The minimum knowledge and skills needed to provide a relevant, valuable solution to a specific problem someone is facing.",
    "explanation": "Minimal Viable Expertise (MVE) challenges the assumption that you need to be a world-class expert before helping others. Instead, it focuses on having just enough expertise to solve a specific problem for a specific person—and being honest about that scope.\n\n**The Core Insight:**\nYou don't need to know everything; you need to know the right thing for the right person at the right time. Someone one step ahead of a beginner is often better positioned to help that beginner than a world expert, because they remember the struggles and speak the language.\n\n**The MVE Framework:**\n1. **Identify a concrete problem** - Not vague goals, but specific pain points\n2. **Define your target** - Who exactly has this problem?\n3. **Determine minimum knowledge** - What's the essential insight that solves it?\n4. **Validate your solution** - Does it actually work for real people?\n5. **Scope your claims** - Be honest about what you can and cannot help with\n\n**Why MVE Works:**\n- **Relevance beats comprehensiveness** - Targeted solutions outperform generic expertise\n- **Proximity aids teaching** - Recent learners understand beginner struggles\n- **Action beats accumulation** - Helping people teaches more than studying\n- **Iteration improves expertise** - Expertise grows through application\n\n**The Expertise Spectrum:**\n- **No expertise:** Can't help anyone\n- **MVE:** Can help specific people with specific problems\n- **Growing expertise:** Can help more people with more problems\n- **Deep expertise:** Can help anyone in your domain\n\n**Ethical Boundaries:**\n- Be honest about your scope and limitations\n- Don't claim expertise you don't have\n- Refer out when problems exceed your competence\n- Continuously expand your expertise\n\n**Application:**\nInstead of waiting until you're an 'expert,' identify one concrete problem you can solve today. Help people with that specific problem. Expand from there.",
