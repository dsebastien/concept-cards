    "summary": "The costs incurred when changing from one product, service, or state to another.",
    "explanation": "Switching costs are the costs incurred when changing from one product, service, state, or approach to another. These include: financial costs (actual money to switch), time costs (effort to transition), learning costs (mastering new systems), psychological costs (discomfort of change), and relationship costs (breaking connections). Switching costs explain: why people stay with inferior options, why first-mover advantage can persist, and why change is harder than it 'should' be. High switching costs create: lock-in (difficult to leave), inertia (staying despite alternatives), and stickiness (users remain even when unhappy). Understanding switching costs helps: evaluate decisions to switch (are benefits worth costs?), recognize when costs are keeping you stuck, and design for reduced switching costs when appropriate. They can be: real (actual resource costs) or perceived (overestimated difficulty). For knowledge workers, switching costs explain: resistance to changing tools, stickiness of workflows, and the value of standardization - and suggest evaluating both costs of switching and costs of staying.",
