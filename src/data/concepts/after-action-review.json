    "summary": "A structured debriefing process to analyze what happened, why it happened, and how to improve, originally developed by the U.S. Army.",
    "explanation": "An After-Action Review (AAR) is a structured review process for analyzing what happened, why it happened, and how it can be done better. Developed by the U.S. Army in the 1970s, the AAR has become one of the most widely adopted organizational learning practices, used in military, business, healthcare, emergency response, and many other contexts.\n\n**The AAR structure**:\n\nThe traditional AAR format centers on four key questions:\n\n1. **What was supposed to happen?** (Planned)\n   - What were our objectives?\n   - What was the plan?\n   - What outcomes did we expect?\n\n2. **What actually happened?** (Reality)\n   - What occurred?\n   - What were the actual outcomes?\n   - What's the factual timeline of events?\n\n3. **Why did it happen?** (Analysis)\n   - What caused the gap between planned and actual?\n   - What worked well and why?\n   - What didn't work and why?\n   - What external factors influenced results?\n\n4. **What can we do better next time?** (Learning)\n   - What should we sustain (keep doing)?\n   - What should we improve (do differently)?\n   - What should we start or stop doing?\n   - What specific actions will we take?\n\n**Principles for effective AARs**:\n\n- **No blame**: Focus on learning, not assigning fault. Psychological safety is essential.\n- **Participant-driven**: Those who did the work should do the analysis\n- **Facts first**: Establish what actually happened before analyzing why\n- **Everyone contributes**: All perspectives are valuable; rank is left at the door\n- **Candor**: Honest assessment requires safe environment for truth-telling\n- **Focus on improvement**: The purpose is future performance, not historical judgment\n- **Timely**: Conduct soon after events while memory is fresh\n- **Action-oriented**: End with specific, assignable improvement actions\n\n**Types of AARs**:\n\n- **Formal AARs**: Scheduled, comprehensive reviews after significant events or projects\n- **Informal AARs**: Quick discussions immediately after smaller activities\n- **Personal AARs**: Individual reflection using the same framework\n\n**Conducting an AAR**:\n\n1. **Preparation**: Gather relevant data, timeline, and metrics\n2. **Introduction**: Set tone (learning, not blame), review ground rules\n3. **Review objectives**: What were we trying to achieve?\n4. **Summary of events**: Build shared understanding of what happened\n5. **Analysis**: Discuss gaps between intended and actual results\n6. **Lessons and recommendations**: Identify insights and improvement actions\n7. **Documentation**: Record key findings for organizational memory\n8. **Follow-up**: Ensure lessons are implemented and shared\n\n**Common pitfalls**:\n\n- Turning into blame sessions rather than learning opportunities\n- Focusing only on what went wrong, ignoring successes\n- Vague lessons that don't translate to specific actions\n- Not documenting or sharing findings\n- Failing to implement identified improvements\n- Conducting too long after events when memory has faded\n\n**Personal AARs**:\n\nIndividuals can apply AAR principles to their own work:\n- After completing a project or task, ask the four questions\n- Keep a learning journal to capture insights\n- Review regularly to identify patterns across experiences\n- Connect insights to specific behavior changes\n\nThe AAR is a practical implementation of reflective practice that transforms experience into learning through structured dialogue and action planning.",
