    "summary": "A data-driven, experimental approach to rapid business growth focusing on scalable and repeatable tactics.",
    "explanation": "Growth hacking combines marketing, product development, and data analysis to find efficient ways to grow. Unlike traditional marketing, it emphasizes rapid experimentation across channels and product development, analytical thinking to understand what works, and scalable, often viral, growth mechanisms. Famous examples include Dropbox's referral program (extra storage for invites), Hotmail's email signature ('Get your free email'), and Airbnb's Craigslist integration. The growth hacker mindset questions assumptions and constantly tests new approaches. For creators and knowledge workers, growth hacking means systematically testing content formats, distribution channels, pricing, and viral mechanisms rather than relying on intuition alone. The goal is finding your unique 'growth lever.'",
