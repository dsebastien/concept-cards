    "summary": "The process of reducing the likelihood or impact of identified risks through preventive and corrective actions.",
    "explanation": "Risk mitigation encompasses the strategies and actions taken to reduce the probability of a risk occurring or to minimize its impact if it does occur. It is one of the primary risk treatment options in the risk management process.\n\n**Risk mitigation strategies**:\n\n- **Prevention**: Actions to reduce the likelihood of a risk materializing (e.g., redundant systems, training, quality controls)\n- **Impact reduction**: Actions to minimize consequences if the risk occurs (e.g., insurance, backup systems, emergency plans)\n- **Detection**: Systems to identify risks early when they begin to materialize (e.g., monitoring, alerts, audits)\n- **Contingency planning**: Predefined responses activated when specific risk triggers are hit\n\n**Mitigation planning**:\n\n1. Prioritize risks based on assessment results\n2. Identify potential mitigation actions for each priority risk\n3. Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each mitigation option\n4. Select and implement the most appropriate mitigations\n5. Monitor effectiveness and adjust as needed\n\n**Common mitigation approaches by domain**:\n\n- **IT/Security**: Defense in depth, patching, access controls, encryption\n- **Project management**: Schedule buffers, scope management, resource redundancy\n- **Financial**: Hedging, diversification, insurance, reserves\n- **Operational**: Standard operating procedures, training, preventive maintenance\n\n**Key principles**:\n\n- Mitigation should be proportionate to the risk level\n- The cost of mitigation should not exceed the expected loss\n- Multiple layers of mitigation provide defense in depth\n- Residual risk (risk remaining after mitigation) must be within tolerance\n- Mitigation effectiveness must be regularly evaluated",
