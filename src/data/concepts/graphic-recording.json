    "explanation": "Graphic Recording (also called Graphic Facilitation or Visual Recording) is the practice of creating large-scale visual summaries of meetings, conferences, and events in real-time. A graphic recorder listens to discussions and translates key ideas, themes, and connections into drawings, icons, and text on a large surface visible to all participants.\n\n**Key Elements**:\n- **Live capture**: Created in real-time as discussions unfold\n- **Large format**: Typically on whiteboards, paper rolls, or digital displays\n- **Visual synthesis**: Distills complex discussions into memorable images\n- **Shared artifact**: Creates a common reference point for participants\n\n**Benefits**:\n- Increases engagement and attention during meetings\n- Helps participants see the big picture and connections\n- Creates memorable documentation of discussions\n- Supports different learning styles (visual learners)\n- Encourages creative and divergent thinking\n- Provides shareable summary of events\n\n**Techniques Used**:\n- Simple iconography and symbols\n- Typography and hand lettering\n- Color coding for themes\n- Spatial organization of ideas\n- Metaphors and visual frameworks\n\n**Relationship to Sketchnoting**:\nWhile sketchnoting is personal and small-scale, graphic recording is public and large-scale. Both use similar visual vocabulary but serve different purposes—personal understanding vs. group documentation.\n\n**In PKM Context**:\nThe principles of graphic recording can enhance personal note-taking by encouraging visual synthesis and big-picture thinking during learning and meetings.",
