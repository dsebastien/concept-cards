    "explanation": "A landing page is a focused webpage with one purpose: getting visitors to take a specific action (sign up, purchase, download, register). Unlike regular website pages with multiple navigation options, landing pages remove distractions to maximize conversions. Key elements include: a compelling headline, clear value proposition, supporting visuals, social proof (testimonials, logos, numbers), benefit-focused copy, and a prominent call-to-action. Landing pages are essential for advertising campaigns, email marketing, and product launches because they match visitor intent with a clear next step. For creators and knowledge workers, landing pages convert traffic into email subscribers, course students, or customers. Testing different elements continuously improves performance.",
