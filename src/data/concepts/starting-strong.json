    "summary": "Beginning tasks and projects with high energy and focus while building sustainable momentum rather than unsustainable spikes.",
    "explanation": "Starting Strong is the practice of beginning new tasks, projects, or endeavors with deliberate energy and focus, while ensuring this initial intensity is sustainable rather than a short-lived burst that leads to burnout.\n\n**The Balance**:\n\nStarting strong doesn't mean working at maximum intensity until exhaustion. Instead, it means:\n\n- **Establishing solid foundations**: Setting up systems, processes, and habits from day one\n- **Building momentum thoughtfully**: Creating forward motion that can be maintained\n- **Front-loading important decisions**: Making key choices while energy and clarity are high\n- **Creating positive patterns**: Establishing sustainable rhythms early\n\n**Why It Matters**:\n\n1. **First impressions compound**: How you start often determines the trajectory\n2. **Systems beat willpower**: Early investment in systems pays dividends later\n3. **Momentum is easier to maintain than create**: Starting with energy makes continuation easier\n4. **Early wins build confidence**: Strong beginnings generate motivation for the long haul\n\n**The Sustainability Connection**:\n\nThe key insight is that starting strong and sustainable pace are not opposites—they're complementary:\n\n- A strong start establishes the systems that enable sustainable pace\n- Sustainable pace preserves the energy needed to start strong on the next thing\n- Both require intentionality rather than reactive work patterns\n\n**Practical Application**:\n\n- **Plan before starting**: Know what 'strong' looks like for this specific endeavor\n- **Build in recovery**: Schedule rest alongside intense beginnings\n- **Create checkpoints**: Assess sustainability at regular intervals\n- **Design for maintenance**: Ask 'Can I keep this up?' not just 'Can I do this now?'\n\n**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:\n\n- Heroic sprints followed by collapse\n- Starting multiple things intensely simultaneously\n- Confusing busyness with strong beginnings\n- Neglecting systems in favor of raw effort",
