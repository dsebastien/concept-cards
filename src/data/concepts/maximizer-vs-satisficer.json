    "summary": "Two opposing decision-making styles: maximizers seek the best possible option while satisficers choose the first option meeting their criteria.",
    "explanation": "Psychologist Barry Schwartz introduced this distinction to describe how people approach choices. Maximizers exhaustively evaluate all available options to find the optimal one. They compare, research, and second-guess to ensure they have made the absolute best choice. Satisficers, by contrast, define a set of acceptable criteria and select the first option that meets them. Neither style is inherently superior. Maximizers often achieve objectively better outcomes but experience more regret, decision fatigue, and dissatisfaction because they constantly wonder if something better existed. Satisficers tend to be happier with their choices and spend less time and energy deciding. Understanding which mode you default to helps you deliberately choose the right approach for each situation. For high-stakes irreversible decisions, maximizing may be worth the cost. For everyday reversible choices, satisficing preserves time and mental energy. The key insight is that the pursuit of the best can become the enemy of the good enough.",
