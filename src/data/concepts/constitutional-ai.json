    "summary": "AI training method using a set of principles (constitution) to guide model behavior and self-improvement.",
    "explanation": "Constitutional AI (CAI) is a training methodology developed by Anthropic for creating AI systems that are helpful, harmless, and honest. It uses a set of explicit principles - a 'constitution' - to guide the model's behavior during training and inference.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. **Supervised Learning**: Initial training on helpful responses\n2. **Constitutional Critique**: The model critiques its own outputs against constitutional principles\n3. **Revision**: The model revises responses based on its critiques\n4. **RLAIF**: Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback uses these revised responses for training\n\n**Key Innovation:**\n\nTraditional RLHF requires extensive human labeling of response quality. CAI reduces this dependency by having the AI evaluate its own outputs against explicit principles, scaling the training process.\n\n**The Constitution:**\n\nA typical constitution includes principles like:\n- Be helpful while avoiding harm\n- Be honest and don't deceive\n- Respect user autonomy\n- Avoid illegal or unethical content\n- Acknowledge uncertainty\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n- **Scalability**: Less human annotation required\n- **Transparency**: Principles are explicit and auditable\n- **Consistency**: Same principles applied across all interactions\n- **Adaptability**: Constitution can be updated for new requirements\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n- Principles must be carefully crafted (garbage in, garbage out)\n- May not capture nuanced ethical situations\n- Model interpretation of principles may differ from human intent\n\nConstitutional AI represents a significant step toward scalable AI alignment, combining explicit values with self-improvement mechanisms.",
