    "summary": "Strategies and efforts to keep existing customers engaged and prevent them from leaving.",
    "explanation": "Customer retention focuses on keeping customers you've already acquired. It's typically 5-25x cheaper to retain customers than acquire new ones, and retained customers spend more over time. Retention strategies include: excellent product/service quality, proactive customer success, regular engagement and value delivery, loyalty programs, feedback loops, and addressing issues quickly. Key metrics are retention rate, churn rate, and customer lifetime value. The root of retention is delivering consistent value—customers stay when the benefit clearly exceeds the cost. For creators, retention might mean: keeping newsletter subscribers engaged, maintaining course community activity, or ensuring membership renewals. Understanding why customers leave (exit surveys, analytics) reveals retention opportunities.",
