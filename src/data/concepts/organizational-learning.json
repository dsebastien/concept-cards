    "explanation": "## What Is Organizational Learning?\n\nOrganizational learning is the process through which an organization acquires, creates, retains, and applies knowledge to adapt its behavior and improve its effectiveness over time. It goes beyond individual learning to encompass how knowledge becomes embedded in organizational routines, culture, systems, and processes.\n\n## Levels of Learning\n\nChris Argyris and Donald Schön distinguished between:\n\n- **Single-loop learning**: detecting and correcting errors within existing norms and assumptions. The organization adjusts actions but doesn't question underlying policies. Like a thermostat that adjusts temperature without questioning the set point.\n- **Double-loop learning**: questioning and modifying the underlying assumptions, norms, and objectives that govern behavior. The organization examines why problems occur and changes its mental models. Like asking whether the temperature set point itself is appropriate.\n- **Triple-loop learning (deutero-learning)**: learning how to learn -- improving the organization's capacity for both single and double-loop learning.\n\n## Barriers to Organizational Learning\n\nOrganizations often struggle to learn because of:\n- **Tribal knowledge**: critical know-how trapped in individuals' heads\n- **Knowledge silos**: departments that don't share across boundaries\n- **Defensive routines**: organizational habits that protect against perceived threats but block learning\n- **Competency traps**: success with current methods that discourages exploring alternatives\n- **Turnover**: losing knowledge when people leave without transfer\n\n## Mechanisms\n\nOrganizational learning happens through: after-action reviews, retrospectives, communities of practice, mentorship programs, documentation systems, knowledge management practices, cross-functional collaboration, and deliberate experimentation.\n\n## Connection to PKM\n\nPersonal knowledge management is the individual foundation of organizational learning. When individuals effectively capture, organize, and share their knowledge, the organization's collective learning capacity increases. Tools like knowledge bases, wikis, and shared repositories bridge individual and organizational learning.",
