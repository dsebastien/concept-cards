    "summary": "The challenge of explaining why and how physical brain processes give rise to subjective conscious experience, as distinguished from the 'easy problems' of explaining cognitive functions.",
    "explanation": "The Hard Problem of Consciousness, coined by philosopher David Chalmers in 1995, is the question of why physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective experience at all. While neuroscience can increasingly explain the mechanics of perception, attention, and behavior (the 'easy problems'), the Hard Problem asks: why does processing information feel like anything from the inside?\n\nChalmers distinguished between 'easy problems' and the Hard Problem. Easy problems include explaining how the brain discriminates stimuli, integrates information, focuses attention, or produces verbal reports. These are 'easy' not because they are simple, but because they are amenable to standard scientific explanation in terms of computational or neural mechanisms. The Hard Problem, by contrast, asks why these processes are accompanied by subjective experience - why there is 'something it is like' to see red or feel pain.\n\nThe Hard Problem has generated several major philosophical responses. Physicalists argue that consciousness will eventually be explained by physical science, perhaps through new discoveries about neural correlates. Property dualists accept that the physical world is causally closed but argue consciousness involves non-physical properties. Mysterians like Colin McGinn suggest human minds may be constitutionally incapable of solving the problem. And some philosophers, notably Daniel Dennett, argue the Hard Problem is itself an illusion generated by confused intuitions.\n\nThe Hard Problem connects to practical questions in AI (could a machine be conscious?), medicine (how do we detect consciousness in unresponsive patients?), and ethics (which entities deserve moral consideration based on their capacity for experience?).",
