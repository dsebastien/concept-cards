    "explanation": "Expertise is the superior performance that comes from extensive experience and deliberate practice in a specific domain. Research by Anders Ericsson revealed that experts don't just know more—they perceive differently, chunking information into meaningful patterns. Chess masters, for example, see positions rather than individual pieces.\n\nThe popular '10,000 hours rule' (attributed to Malcolm Gladwell) oversimplifies Ericsson's finding: what matters is deliberate practice—focused, feedback-driven training at the edge of one's abilities. Mere repetition doesn't create expertise; purposeful improvement does.\n\nExpertise is notably domain-specific. Chess grandmasters have ordinary memory for random positions; their expertise only manifests in meaningful game configurations. Expert intuition, as Daniel Kahneman and Gary Klein agree, is essentially pattern recognition from accumulated experience—reliable only in high-validity environments with clear feedback.\n\nHubert Dreyfus proposed five stages of skill acquisition: novice (follows explicit rules), advanced beginner (recognizes situational elements), competent (makes deliberate choices), proficient (sees holistically, acts intuitively), and expert (fluid, embodied, transcends rules). At the expert level, performance becomes automatic and embodied rather than rule-based.",
