    "explanation": "Late mover advantage refers to the competitive benefits that companies gain by entering a market after first movers have pioneered it. While first mover advantage gets more attention, late movers can benefit from: learning from pioneers' mistakes, free-riding on first mover investments in customer education and infrastructure, adopting superior technology that wasn't available to pioneers, and entering when market uncertainty has been reduced. Late movers can observe what works, avoid costly errors, and leapfrog incumbents with better solutions. Classic examples include: Google entering after earlier search engines, Facebook after MySpace, and Samsung smartphones after Apple's iPhone established the market. Late mover advantage is strongest when: technology evolves rapidly, customer needs are initially unclear, switching costs are low, and first movers make strategic errors. Understanding both first and late mover dynamics helps with market entry timing decisions.",
