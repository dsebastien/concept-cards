    "summary": "A metric measuring how products or services meet or exceed customer expectations.",
    "explanation": "Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) measures immediate happiness with a specific interaction, product, or experience. Typically measured through surveys asking 'How satisfied were you?' on a 1-5 scale, CSAT captures point-in-time sentiment. CSAT differs from NPS (which measures loyalty/recommendation) and CES (which measures effort required). High CSAT indicates you're meeting expectations; low CSAT signals problems needing attention. Track CSAT after key touchpoints: purchase, support interaction, feature use, or course completion. For creators, CSAT might measure: satisfaction with a course module, support response, or product quality. The follow-up question 'What could we improve?' transforms scores into actionable insights. CSAT is a leading indicator—satisfaction today predicts retention tomorrow.",
