    "explanation": "Data availability is the assurance that data and systems are accessible when needed by authorized users. It's one of the three pillars of information security (CIA: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). High availability matters because: unavailable data is effectively lost (even temporarily), downtime has real costs (business, safety, productivity), and some data is time-critical (delays reduce value). Threats to availability: hardware failure (disks, servers), software bugs (crashes, corruption), network issues (connectivity loss), attacks (DoS, ransomware), and disasters (fire, flood, power loss). Ensuring availability involves: redundancy (multiple copies, backup systems), fault tolerance (systems continue despite failures), backup and recovery (ability to restore), geographic distribution (survive site-specific disasters), and monitoring (detect and respond to issues). Availability is often measured as 'nines': 99% (3.65 days downtime/year), 99.9% (8.76 hours), 99.99% (52.6 minutes). Higher availability requires exponentially more investment. For knowledge workers, data availability means: ensuring access to information when needed, planning for failures, and balancing availability requirements with cost and complexity.",
