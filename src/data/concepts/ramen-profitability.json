    "explanation": "Ramen profitability, a term coined by Paul Graham of Y Combinator, describes the state where a startup generates just enough revenue to cover the founders' basic living expenses - enough to eat ramen noodles and pay rent, but not much more.\n\n**Why It Matters:**\n\nReaching ramen profitability is a crucial milestone for bootstrapped startups because it:\n\n1. **Extends runway indefinitely**: You can keep working on your business without burning through savings\n2. **Reduces pressure**: You're no longer racing against a funding deadline\n3. **Proves viability**: Someone is willing to pay for what you're building\n4. **Enables focus**: You can dedicate full attention to the business\n5. **Improves negotiating position**: If you do seek funding, you negotiate from strength\n\n**The Psychology:**\n\nRamen profitability provides psychological freedom. You're no longer asking \"Will I run out of money?\" but instead \"How do I grow from here?\" This subtle shift from survival mode to growth mode changes everything about how you approach decisions.\n\n**Getting There:**\n\n- Launch early, even if imperfect\n- Charge from day one\n- Keep personal expenses minimal\n- Focus on revenue-generating activities\n- Find your first paying customers before adding features\n\n**Beyond Ramen:**\n\nRamen profitability is a waypoint, not a destination. Once achieved, founders typically aim for:\n- Default alive status (profitable trajectory)\n- Comfortable profitability (market-rate salary)\n- Growth investment capacity (reinvesting profits)\n\nThe beauty of ramen profitability is its simplicity: it's a clear, achievable milestone that transforms your startup's trajectory.",
