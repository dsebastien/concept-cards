    "name": "Societal Inertia",
    "summary": "The tendency of societies to resist change due to the combined weight of entrenched systems, norms, institutions, and collective habits, even when change would be beneficial.",
    "explanation": "Societal inertia is the resistance to change that emerges from the accumulated weight of a society's institutions, norms, infrastructure, beliefs, and collective habits. Like physical inertia (an object in motion tends to stay in motion), a society moving in a particular direction tends to keep moving that way, and the larger and more complex the society, the harder it is to alter course.\n\n**Sources of Societal Inertia:**\n\n- **Institutional inertia**: Organizations, legal systems, and bureaucracies develop procedures optimized for existing conditions. Changing them requires overcoming entrenched interests, rewriting regulations, and retraining people\n- **Path dependence**: Past decisions constrain future options. Infrastructure, technology standards, and social norms create lock-in effects that make alternatives increasingly costly over time\n- **Cultural lag**: Technology and material conditions change faster than values, beliefs, and social norms, creating a persistent gap between what is possible and what is socially accepted\n- **Status quo bias**: Individuals psychologically prefer the current state, seeing change as riskier than inaction even when evidence suggests otherwise\n- **System justification**: People actively defend existing systems as fair and legitimate, rationalizing their flaws rather than pushing for reform\n- **Collective action problems**: Even when most individuals want change, coordination costs, free-rider problems, and diffused responsibility prevent collective action\n- **Economic interests**: Incumbent industries, professions, and power structures actively resist changes that threaten their position\n\n**Why It Matters:**\n\nSocietal inertia explains why obvious improvements often take decades to implement. Clean energy transitions, educational reform, healthcare modernization, and digital transformation all face societal inertia far beyond the technical challenges involved. Understanding the specific sources of inertia in a given situation helps identify leverage points for change.\n\n**Overcoming Societal Inertia:**\n\n- **Crisis events**: External shocks (wars, pandemics, economic crashes) can temporarily reduce inertia by making the status quo untenable\n- **Overton Window shifts**: Gradually expanding the range of acceptable discourse to include new ideas\n- **Technological disruption**: New technologies that make old systems obsolete can force adaptation\n- **Generational turnover**: Younger generations who never internalized old norms adopt new ones more readily\n- **Institutional entrepreneurship**: Change agents who work within institutions to reform them from the inside\n- **Demonstration effects**: Successful examples in other societies or sectors that prove alternatives are viable",
