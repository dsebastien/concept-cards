    "explanation": "Search Engine Marketing, primarily through Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertising, places ads in search results for specific keywords. You bid on keywords relevant to your business, create ad copy, and pay only when someone clicks. Key platforms are Google Ads and Microsoft Advertising. Success requires: thorough keyword research, compelling ad copy, relevant landing pages, and continuous optimization of bids, targeting, and creative. Metrics include Cost Per Click (CPC), Click-Through Rate (CTR), conversion rate, and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS). SEM provides immediate visibility (unlike SEO's gradual build) and precise targeting. For creators, PPC can promote launches, test messaging, and reach people actively searching for solutions—but requires budget and expertise to be profitable.",
