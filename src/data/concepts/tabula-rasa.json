    "summary": "The philosophical idea that humans are born without innate mental content, and all knowledge comes from experience and sensory perception.",
    "explanation": "Tabula rasa, Latin for 'blank slate', is the epistemological theory that individuals are born without built-in mental content. This concept, most famously associated with John Locke's empiricism, proposes that all knowledge is derived from experience and sensory perception rather than innate ideas.\n\nThe theory significantly shaped Enlightenment thinking and influenced 20th-century behaviorism. John B. Watson, the founder of behaviorism, famously claimed he could take any infant and shape them into any type of specialist through environmental conditioning alone.\n\nHowever, Steven Pinker's influential book 'The Blank Slate' (2002) argues this view is empirically false. Evidence from behavioral genetics, evolutionary psychology, and neuroscience demonstrates that the human mind has innate structure and predispositions. The modern scientific consensus recognizes that both genetic inheritance and environmental factors play crucial roles in shaping human cognition and behavior. The mind is neither a completely blank slate nor rigidly predetermined by genes, but rather develops through the complex interaction of nature and nurture.",
