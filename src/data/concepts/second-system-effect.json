    "explanation": "The Second-System Effect describes the tendency for an engineer's second system to be over-engineered and bloated. After the disciplined constraints of a first system, the designer is emboldened by success and tempted to include all the features and ideas they had to leave out. Fred Brooks observed this pattern at IBM with OS/360, where the team over-designed after the relative simplicity of earlier systems.\n\nThe effect manifests in several ways: feature creep, where unnecessary capabilities are added; excessive generalization, where the system tries to handle every conceivable use case; and premature optimization, where performance concerns override simplicity. Each of these tendencies stems from the same root cause — the designer's confidence has outgrown the discipline that made the first system successful.\n\nThe antidote to the second-system effect is conscious discipline, architectural review, and maintaining conceptual integrity. Brooks recommended that designers be aware of this tendency and actively resist the urge to over-embellish. Having experienced architects review proposals and enforce constraints helps keep the design focused.\n\nThe second-system effect is a specific case of overconfidence bias applied to engineering. It is relevant whenever a team rebuilds or rewrites a system, and it applies beyond software to any domain where a successful first effort leads to an overly ambitious follow-up. Modern software teams encounter this pattern during major rewrites, platform migrations, and v2 product launches.",
