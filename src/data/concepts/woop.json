    "summary": "A mental strategy that combines positive visualization with obstacle identification to bridge the intention-action gap: Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan.",
    "explanation": "WOOP (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan) is an evidence-based mental strategy developed by psychologist Gabriele Oettingen based on over 20 years of research on motivation and goal achievement. It combines mental contrasting (comparing desired futures with present obstacles) with implementation intentions (if-then planning) into a practical four-step technique.\n\n**The four steps:**\n\n1. **Wish**: Identify a meaningful goal or wish that is challenging but feasible. It should be something you genuinely care about and can realistically pursue.\n\n2. **Outcome**: Vividly imagine the best possible outcome of fulfilling your wish. What would it feel like? What would it look like? Engage all your senses in this positive visualization.\n\n3. **Obstacle**: Identify the main internal obstacle that stands in the way. This is the critical step that distinguishes WOOP from pure positive thinking. What within you—a habit, emotion, belief, or impulse—could prevent you from achieving your wish?\n\n4. **Plan**: Create an if-then plan: 'If [obstacle occurs], then I will [specific action].' This pre-programs your response to the obstacle, making it automatic rather than requiring willpower in the moment.\n\n**Why WOOP works (and positive thinking alone doesn't):**\n\nOettingen's research showed that pure positive fantasizing about the future actually reduces motivation by tricking the brain into feeling the goal is already achieved. By adding obstacle identification (mental contrasting), the mind registers the gap between desire and reality, generating the energy needed for action. The implementation intention then channels that energy into a specific behavioral response.\n\n**Research evidence:**\n\nStudies have shown WOOP improves outcomes across diverse domains:\n- Students achieved better grades and attendance\n- Dieters ate more fruits and vegetables\n- Chronic pain patients increased physical activity\n- Professionals improved time management and reduced stress\n- Smokers reduced cigarette consumption\n\n**Key distinctions:**\n\n- WOOP identifies **internal** obstacles (your own thoughts, feelings, habits), not external ones\n- The obstacle should be the **main** barrier, not a comprehensive list\n- The technique takes only 5-15 minutes per goal\n- It can reveal that some wishes aren't actually worth pursuing (which is valuable information)\n\n**Connection to other techniques:**\n\nWOOP integrates two well-established psychological techniques: mental contrasting (Oettingen) and implementation intentions (Peter Gollwitzer). It can be combined with other goal-achievement methods and serves as a complement to pre-commitment strategies by identifying which commitments to make.",
