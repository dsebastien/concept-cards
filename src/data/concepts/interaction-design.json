  "summary": "The practice of designing interactive digital products, environments, systems, and services with a focus on behavior—how users interact with them through actions, responses, feedback, and flows.",
  "explanation": "Interaction Design (IxD) is the practice of designing interactive digital products, environments, systems, and services with a focus on behavior—how users interact with them. The term was coined by Bill Moggridge and Bill Verplank in the mid-1980s at IDEO. While User Experience (UX) encompasses the entire user journey, interaction design specifically focuses on the moment-to-moment dialogue between user and product: actions, responses, feedback, and flows.\n\n**The Five Dimensions of Interaction Design**:\n\n1. **Words (1D)**: Text, labels, and microcopy like button labels and error messages\n2. **Visual (2D)**: Images, typography, icons, and interface graphics\n3. **Physical (3D)**: Hardware and space—mouse, touchscreen, keyboard\n4. **Time (4D)**: Animation, sound, and duration—loading indicators, transitions\n5. **Behavior (5D)**: How the product responds—feedback and state changes\n\n**Core Concepts**:\n\n- **Affordance**: What actions are possible\n- **Signifier**: What communicates affordances\n- **Feedback**: Response to user actions\n- **Mapping**: Relationship between control and effect\n- **Constraints**: Limiting possible actions\n- **Consistency**: Predictable patterns\n- **Mental Model**: User's understanding of the system\n\n**Common Interaction Patterns**:\n\n- **Direct manipulation**: Drag and drop, resize\n- **Menu selection**: Choosing from options\n- **Form fill-in**: Data entry\n- **Command line**: Expert text input\n- **Conversational**: Chatbots, voice assistants\n- **Gesture**: Touch, motion control\n- **WIMP**: Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer\n\n**The Design Process**:\n\n1. **Research**: User interviews, observation, analysis\n2. **Define**: Personas, scenarios, requirements\n3. **Ideate**: Sketching, wireframing, flow diagrams\n4. **Prototype**: Interactive mockups, clickable prototypes\n5. **Test**: Usability testing, iteration\n6. **Implement**: Collaboration with development\n\n**IxD vs Related Fields**:\n\n| Field | Focus |\n|-------|-------|\n| Interaction Design | Behavior, moment-to-moment dialogue |\n| UX Design | Entire user journey, holistic |\n| UI Design | Visual appearance, layout |\n| HCI | Research-focused, theoretical |\n\nInteraction design draws on cognitive psychology, human-computer interaction, and product design. Key concerns include defining how products behave in response to user input, designing clear affordances and signifiers, providing appropriate feedback, and creating coherent interaction patterns.",
