    "summary": "Long periods of stability interrupted by brief periods of rapid, dramatic change.",
    "explanation": "Punctuated equilibrium is a pattern where systems remain relatively stable for extended periods (stasis), then undergo rapid, dramatic transformations in short bursts before settling into a new stable state. Originally proposed by paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould in 1972 to explain patterns in the fossil record, the concept has become a powerful mental model applicable far beyond evolutionary biology.\n\nIn evolution, Gould and Eldredge observed that species tend to remain morphologically stable for millions of years, then change rapidly during speciation events, rather than evolving gradually and continuously as Darwin's gradualism suggested. The fossil record shows long periods of little change punctuated by sudden appearances of new forms.\n\nThe pattern appears across many domains. In technology, long periods of incremental improvement are interrupted by disruptive innovations that reshape entire industries (horse-drawn transport for centuries, then automobiles in decades). In personal development, people often plateau for extended periods before experiencing breakthrough moments that rapidly transform their capabilities. In organizations, companies operate under stable routines until crises or new leadership trigger rapid restructuring. In science, normal science proceeds incrementally until anomalies accumulate and trigger paradigm shifts.\n\nKey characteristics of punctuated equilibrium include: stability is the norm and change is the exception; when change comes, it is rapid relative to the periods of stability; the system settles into a new equilibrium after the punctuation event; and accumulated pressures during stable periods often drive the eventual rapid change.\n\nFor individuals and organizations, this model suggests: don't mistake current stability for permanent stability; prepare during stable periods for eventual disruption; recognize that progress often looks like nothing is happening until suddenly everything changes; and understand that forcing gradual change may be less effective than creating conditions for punctuated breakthroughs. The pattern validates patience during plateaus while maintaining readiness for transformation.",
