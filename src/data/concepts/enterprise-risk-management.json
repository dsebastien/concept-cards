    "summary": "A holistic approach to managing all types of risk across an organization in an integrated and strategic manner.",
    "explanation": "Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is a comprehensive, organization-wide approach to identifying, assessing, and managing risks that could affect the achievement of strategic objectives. Unlike traditional risk management that operates in silos (financial risk, operational risk, compliance risk), ERM integrates all risk categories into a unified framework.\n\n**Key principles of ERM**:\n\n- **Holistic view**: Considers the full spectrum of risks and their interactions\n- **Strategic alignment**: Links risk management to organizational strategy and objectives\n- **Portfolio approach**: Evaluates risks collectively, not in isolation, recognizing that diversification and correlation matter\n- **Value creation**: Views risk management as creating value, not just preventing loss\n- **Cultural integration**: Embeds risk awareness throughout the organization\n\n**Major ERM frameworks**:\n\n- **COSO ERM** (2017): Committee of Sponsoring Organizations framework integrating risk with strategy and performance\n- **ISO 31000**: International standard providing principles, framework, and process for risk management\n- **FERMA**: Federation of European Risk Management Associations framework\n\n**ERM components** (COSO):\n\n1. Governance and culture\n2. Strategy and objective-setting\n3. Performance (identifying, assessing, prioritizing risks)\n4. Review and revision\n5. Information, communication, and reporting\n\n**Benefits of ERM**:\n\n- Better strategic decision-making by understanding risk-reward trade-offs\n- Improved operational efficiency through coordinated risk responses\n- Enhanced stakeholder confidence and regulatory compliance\n- Reduced surprises and improved organizational resilience\n- More effective capital and resource allocation\n\n**Challenges**:\n\n- Requires significant cultural change and leadership commitment\n- Difficult to quantify all risk types consistently\n- Risk of bureaucracy if not implemented pragmatically\n- Requires cross-functional collaboration that may challenge organizational silos",
