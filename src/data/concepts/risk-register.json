    "summary": "A structured document that records identified risks along with their analysis, treatment plans, and current status.",
    "explanation": "A risk register (also called a risk log) is a foundational risk management tool that provides a centralized record of all identified risks, their assessment, planned responses, and current status. It serves as the primary document for tracking and managing risks throughout a project, program, or organization.\n\n**Typical risk register contents**:\n\n- **Risk ID**: Unique identifier for tracking\n- **Risk description**: Clear statement of the risk event and its potential consequences\n- **Category**: Classification of the risk type (financial, operational, strategic, etc.)\n- **Likelihood**: Probability of the risk occurring (often on a 1-5 scale)\n- **Impact**: Severity of consequences if the risk materializes (often on a 1-5 scale)\n- **Risk score**: Calculated from likelihood × impact\n- **Risk owner**: Person accountable for managing the risk\n- **Mitigation actions**: Planned and implemented responses\n- **Status**: Current state of the risk (open, mitigating, closed, materialized)\n- **Residual risk**: Risk level remaining after mitigation\n\n**Best practices**:\n\n- Review and update regularly (at minimum quarterly, monthly for active projects)\n- Ensure all risks have clear owners\n- Track mitigation action completion\n- Use consistent scoring criteria across the organization\n- Make the register accessible to relevant stakeholders\n- Record lessons learned when risks materialize or are closed\n\n**Common pitfalls**:\n\n- Treating it as a one-time exercise rather than a living document\n- Listing risks without clear ownership or actions\n- Using inconsistent or unclear rating scales\n- Focusing only on negative risks and ignoring opportunities\n- Creating overly complex registers that discourage use",
