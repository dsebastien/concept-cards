    "summary": "The perceived likelihood that a path (link, button, navigation element) will lead to the desired information, based on cues like labels, descriptions, and context.",
    "explanation": "Information scent is a concept from information foraging theory that describes how users assess whether a particular path will lead them to what they're looking for. Users follow scent trails of cues to navigate toward their goals, much like animals follow scent trails to food.\n\n**How Information Scent Works**:\n\nUsers evaluate links and navigation elements based on:\n- **Labels**: Does the text match what I'm looking for?\n- **Descriptions**: Does the preview or summary seem relevant?\n- **Context**: Does the surrounding content support this path?\n- **Visual cues**: Does it look like other successful paths?\n\n**Strong vs. Weak Scent**:\n\n**Strong Information Scent**:\n- Clear, descriptive labels\n- Relevant keywords visible\n- Obvious connection to user's goal\n- Users click confidently\n\n**Weak Information Scent**:\n- Vague or clever labels (\"Discover More\")\n- Missing context or descriptions\n- Ambiguous icons without text\n- Users hesitate or abandon\n\n**Practical Applications**:\n\n**Navigation Design**:\n- Use clear, specific labels\n- Include descriptive subtitles\n- Show breadcrumbs for orientation\n- Highlight the current location\n\n**Link Text**:\n- Avoid \"Click here\" or \"Learn more\"\n- Use descriptive anchor text\n- Front-load keywords\n- Match user vocabulary\n\n**Search Results**:\n- Show relevant snippets\n- Highlight matching terms\n- Include metadata (dates, categories)\n- Provide clear titles\n\n**Content Strategy**:\n- Use headings as signposts\n- Include summaries and previews\n- Maintain consistent terminology\n- Match content to navigation labels\n\n**Why It Matters**:\n\n- Users satisfice—they follow the strongest scent, not the best path\n- Weak scent causes abandonment\n- Users won't explore if they can't predict outcomes\n- Scent degrades with each unsuccessful click\n\n**Testing Information Scent**:\n\n- Tree testing: Can users find items in your navigation?\n- First-click testing: Where do users click to accomplish tasks?\n- Card sorting: Do your categories match user mental models?\n\nImproving information scent is one of the highest-impact usability improvements you can make.",
