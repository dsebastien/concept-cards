    "explanation": "Risk assessment is the systematic process of identifying potential hazards, analyzing their likelihood and consequences, and evaluating the resulting risk level to determine appropriate responses. It is a critical component of the broader risk management process.\n\n**Risk assessment steps**:\n\n1. **Hazard identification**: Systematically identifying what could go wrong, using techniques like brainstorming, checklists, failure mode analysis, and historical data review\n2. **Risk analysis**: Determining the likelihood and potential impact of each identified risk. This can be qualitative (high/medium/low), semi-quantitative (scoring scales), or quantitative (probability distributions)\n3. **Risk evaluation**: Comparing risk levels against acceptance criteria and prioritizing risks for treatment\n\n**Common risk assessment tools**:\n\n- **Risk matrix**: Visual grid plotting likelihood against impact\n- **FMEA**: Failure Mode and Effects Analysis for systematic evaluation\n- **Fault tree analysis**: Top-down deductive analysis of failure causes\n- **Bow-tie analysis**: Visual representation of risk pathways from causes to consequences\n- **Monte Carlo simulation**: Quantitative modeling of risk scenarios\n\n**Qualitative vs. quantitative assessment**:\n\n- Qualitative methods use descriptive scales and are faster but less precise\n- Quantitative methods use numerical probabilities and financial values but require more data\n- Most organizations use a combination, starting qualitative and moving to quantitative for critical risks\n\n**Best practices**:\n\n- Involve diverse perspectives to avoid blind spots\n- Base assessments on evidence, not assumptions\n- Document methodology and rationale\n- Review and update assessments regularly\n- Consider both threats and opportunities",
