    "summary": "The third level of reading involving thorough, systematic reading for complete understanding through questioning and critical evaluation.",
    "explanation": "Analytical Reading is the third level of reading described by Mortimer Adler in 'How to Read a Book.' It represents complete, thorough reading for the sake of understanding, where the reader actively engages with the text to extract maximum meaning.\n\nAnalytical reading involves four key questions that guide the process: **What is the book about as a whole?** Identify the leading theme and how the author develops it. **What is being said in detail, and how?** Understand the main ideas, assertions, and arguments. **Is the book true, in whole or in part?** Evaluate the author's claims critically. **What of it?** Consider the significance and implications of what you've learned.\n\nThe process includes multiple stages: First, classifying the book by kind and subject matter. Second, stating the unity of the whole book in a single sentence or short paragraph. Third, setting forth the major parts and showing how they are organized. Fourth, defining the problem or problems the author is trying to solve.\n\nAnalytical reading requires active engagement: coming to terms with the author (understanding key words), determining the author's propositions, knowing the author's arguments, and determining which problems were solved and which remain unsolved.\n\nThis level of reading is essential for truly understanding demanding books. Unlike inspectional reading which asks 'What is this book about?', analytical reading asks 'What does this book mean?' It transforms reading from passive reception into active dialogue with the author.",
