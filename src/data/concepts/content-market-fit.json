    "summary": "The alignment between your content and what your target audience actively wants and needs.",
    "explanation": "Content-Market Fit, analogous to product-market fit, describes when your content consistently resonates with a specific audience. It's the point where creating content feels like filling demand rather than pushing messages into the void.\n\n**Signs of Content-Market Fit:**\n- Content gets shared organically\n- Comments say 'this is exactly what I needed'\n- Audience grows without paid promotion\n- Engagement rates increase over time\n- People ask for more of specific content types\n- Content ideas come from audience requests\n\n**Signs You Don't Have It:**\n- Posting feels like shouting into the void\n- Low engagement despite consistent effort\n- Audience doesn't grow or churns quickly\n- You're guessing what people want\n- Metrics are flat regardless of effort\n\n**Finding Content-Market Fit:**\n\n1. **Define your audience narrowly**\n   - Specific > general\n   - 'Developers learning React' > 'tech people'\n\n2. **Experiment with formats and topics**\n   - Track what resonates\n   - Double down on winners\n\n3. **Listen actively**\n   - What questions do people ask?\n   - What do they share?\n   - What generates discussion?\n\n4. **Iterate based on feedback**\n   - More of what works\n   - Less of what doesn't\n\n**The Triad:**\n- **You:** What you can uniquely offer\n- **Audience:** What they want and need\n- **Format:** How they prefer to consume\n\nContent-Market Fit sits at the intersection of all three.\n\n**Timing:**\nFit can take months or years to find. Most creators quit before discovering it. Persistence through the search is essential.",
