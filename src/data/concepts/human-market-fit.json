    "summary": "The alignment between an entrepreneur's personal strengths, interests, and their target market.",
    "explanation": "Human-Market Fit asks whether YOU are the right person to serve a particular market. It's the intersection of your unique skills, genuine interests, and an audience you understand and care about. Even if a market opportunity exists, you won't thrive if it doesn't align with who you are. HMF considers: Do you authentically understand this audience? Do you enjoy the work required? Can you sustain it long-term? Finding HMF prevents burnout and inauthenticity while increasing your chances of success.",
