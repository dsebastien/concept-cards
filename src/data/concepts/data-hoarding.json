    "name": "Data Hoarding",
    "summary": "The compulsive accumulation of digital data far beyond any practical need, driven by the fear of losing potentially useful information.",
    "explanation": "Data hoarding is the digital equivalent of physical hoarding: the compulsive collection and retention of digital data far beyond any realistic need. Data hoarders accumulate vast quantities of files, downloads, backups, and digital content, driven by a combination of 'just in case' thinking, the near-zero marginal cost of storage, and anxiety about information loss.\n\n**Characteristics of data hoarding:**\n\n- Downloading content 'for later' that is never consumed\n- Keeping multiple redundant copies of files across devices\n- Refusing to delete anything because it 'might be useful someday'\n- Accumulating terabytes of media (movies, music, books) never accessed\n- Saving every email, screenshot, and conversation\n- Collecting bookmarks, articles, and links far faster than consuming them\n\n**Why people data hoard:**\n\n- **Loss aversion**: The pain of potentially losing information outweighs the cost of storage\n- **Collector's impulse**: The act of acquiring feels productive\n- **Cheap storage**: Low cost removes natural friction against accumulation\n- **FOMO**: Fear of missing information that might be valuable\n- **Illusion of productivity**: Saving feels like doing\n- **Completionism**: The desire to have 'everything' on a topic\n\n**The collector's fallacy connection:**\n\nChristian Tietze coined 'the collector's fallacy' to describe how collecting information creates an illusion of knowledge. Having a file is not the same as understanding its contents. Data hoarding often substitutes the feeling of learning for actual learning.\n\n**Problems caused by data hoarding:**\n\n- Important content becomes unfindable in the mass of accumulated data\n- Storage costs grow continuously\n- Backups become unwieldy and slow\n- Decision fatigue from too many options\n- Security risks from forgotten sensitive data\n- Psychological burden of unprocessed material\n\n**Healthy alternatives:**\n\n- Curate instead of collect: process and decide on each item\n- Apply the 'will I use this in the next week?' test\n- Trust that information can be re-found when needed\n- Practice regular purging and archival cycles\n- Focus on understanding over accumulation",
