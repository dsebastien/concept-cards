    "summary": "A self-reinforcing content system where each piece of content generates insights, audience, and material that fuels the creation of more content.",
    "explanation": "A Content Flywheel is a systematic approach to content creation where outputs become inputs for future content, creating compounding returns over time. Unlike linear content production (create → publish → repeat), a flywheel builds momentum.\n\n**How the Content Flywheel Works**:\n\n```\nCreate Content → Attract Audience → Gather Feedback\n       ↑                                    ↓\n       ← ← ← Generate New Ideas ← ← ← ← ← ←\n```\n\n**Flywheel Components**:\n\n1. **Creation**: Produce valuable content\n2. **Distribution**: Publish across channels\n3. **Engagement**: Audience interacts, comments, shares\n4. **Feedback**: Learn what resonates\n5. **Ideas**: Generate topics from responses\n6. **Refinement**: Improve based on data\n7. **Repurposing**: Transform content into new formats\n\n**What Makes Content Compound**:\n\n- **SEO content**: Ranks over time, attracts ongoing traffic\n- **Evergreen topics**: Remain relevant for years\n- **Repurposing**: One idea → blog → video → podcast → social\n- **Audience growth**: More readers = more feedback = better content\n- **Authority building**: Each piece reinforces expertise\n\n**Content Flywheel Strategies**:\n\n**The Content Atomization Flywheel**:\n- Create one long-form piece (pillar content)\n- Break into multiple short-form pieces\n- Each short piece drives traffic to the pillar\n- Engagement informs the next pillar topic\n\n**The Feedback Flywheel**:\n- Publish content on a topic\n- Collect questions and objections\n- Answer them in new content\n- Repeat with deeper expertise\n\n**The Distribution Flywheel**:\n- Post content on platform A\n- Best performers get adapted for platform B\n- Cross-promotion builds audience on both\n- Combined audience is greater than the sum\n\n**Building Your Flywheel**:\n\n1. **Start with a hub**: Blog, newsletter, or YouTube channel\n2. **Create pillar content**: Comprehensive pieces on core topics\n3. **Repurpose systematically**: Every piece becomes 5-10 smaller ones\n4. **Track what works**: Double down on resonant topics\n5. **Engage with feedback**: Comments and questions are content gold\n6. **Build systems**: Templates, workflows, batching\n\n**Flywheel vs. Hamster Wheel**:\n\n| Flywheel | Hamster Wheel |\n|----------|---------------|\n| Compounds over time | Resets each time |\n| Evergreen content | Ephemeral content |\n| Systems-driven | Effort-driven |\n| Repurposes heavily | Creates from scratch |\n| Builds on past work | Ignores past work |\n\nThe flywheel takes more effort initially but becomes easier over time. The hamster wheel stays hard forever.",
