    "summary": "A behavioral assessment measuring four personality traits—Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, and Conscientiousness—widely used in workplace settings for team building and communication.",
    "explanation": "DISC is a behavior assessment tool based on the work of psychologist William Moulton Marston. It measures how people tend to behave in their environment, particularly in work settings. Unlike MBTI or Big Five, DISC focuses on observable behavior patterns rather than underlying personality or motivations.\n\n**The Four DISC Styles:**\n\n**D - Dominance**\n- Focus: Results, action, challenge\n- Strengths: Decisive, competitive, direct, risk-taking\n- Under stress: Impatient, insensitive, argumentative\n- Communication: Get to the point quickly, focus on results\n- Motivated by: Control, achievement, winning\n\n**I - Influence**\n- Focus: Relationships, enthusiasm, collaboration\n- Strengths: Optimistic, creative, motivating, persuasive\n- Under stress: Disorganized, impulsive, overly talkative\n- Communication: Allow time for socializing, be enthusiastic\n- Motivated by: Recognition, approval, popularity\n\n**S - Steadiness**\n- Focus: Cooperation, sincerity, dependability\n- Strengths: Patient, reliable, team-oriented, good listener\n- Under stress: Resistant to change, passive-aggressive, indecisive\n- Communication: Be patient, don't rush, show appreciation\n- Motivated by: Stability, harmony, helping others\n\n**C - Conscientiousness**\n- Focus: Quality, accuracy, expertise\n- Strengths: Analytical, systematic, careful, detail-oriented\n- Under stress: Overly critical, perfectionist, analysis paralysis\n- Communication: Provide data and facts, allow time for analysis\n- Motivated by: Accuracy, quality, being right\n\n**Practical applications:**\n- Team composition and role assignment\n- Adapting communication styles\n- Conflict resolution\n- Sales and customer interaction\n- Leadership development\n\nMost people are a blend of styles with one or two dominant. DISC is valued in business for its simplicity and focus on actionable behavioral insights rather than deep psychological analysis.",
