    "summary": "A small software-as-a-service business targeting a niche market, often run by one person or a tiny team.",
    "explanation": "Micro SaaS refers to small, focused software-as-a-service businesses that target specific niches rather than broad markets. Unlike venture-backed SaaS companies pursuing rapid growth, Micro SaaS businesses prioritize profitability, sustainability, and founder lifestyle.\n\n**Defining Characteristics:**\n\n1. **Niche focus**: Solve one specific problem for a specific audience\n2. **Small scale**: Often run by solo founders or teams of 2-3\n3. **Bootstrap-friendly**: Can be built and maintained without external funding\n4. **Sustainable revenue**: Aim for steady recurring revenue, not hockey-stick growth\n5. **Low overhead**: Minimal infrastructure and operational costs\n\n**Common Micro SaaS Categories:**\n\n- Integrations and connectors between existing tools\n- Browser extensions with premium features\n- Niche-specific tools (real estate, dentists, podcasters)\n- Developer tools and utilities\n- Workflow automation for specific industries\n- Add-ons for platforms (Shopify, WordPress, Notion)\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n- Can reach profitability with small customer base (50-500 customers)\n- Recurring revenue provides stability\n- Deep customer relationships enable product-market fit\n- Lower competition in niches than broad markets\n- Full ownership and control\n- Can be run alongside other work\n\n**Building a Micro SaaS:**\n\n1. Find a painful problem in a niche you understand\n2. Validate demand before building\n3. Launch minimal version quickly\n4. Iterate based on customer feedback\n5. Focus on retention over acquisition\n6. Automate and systematize operations\n\n**Revenue Expectations:**\n\nMicro SaaS businesses typically target $5K-50K MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) rather than millions. Success means building a profitable, sustainable business - not raising funding or achieving unicorn status.",
