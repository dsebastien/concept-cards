    "name": "High Agency",
    "summary": "A mindset characterized by taking proactive action, assuming problems are solvable, and not waiting for permission or perfect conditions to act.",
    "explanation": "High agency is a disposition toward taking initiative and assuming personal responsibility for outcomes. High agency individuals operate from the premise that obstacles can be overcome, that they can influence their circumstances, and that waiting for permission or perfect conditions is often unnecessary.\n\n**Characteristics of High Agency People**:\n\n1. **Bias toward action**: They try things rather than endlessly deliberating\n2. **Problem-solving orientation**: They assume problems have solutions and look for them\n3. **Internal locus of control**: They believe their actions matter\n4. **Resourcefulness**: They work with available resources rather than waiting for ideal conditions\n5. **Ownership mentality**: They take responsibility rather than blaming circumstances\n6. **Permission-seeking aversion**: They act first when stakes are low rather than asking for approval\n7. **Failure tolerance**: They view failures as learning opportunities, not permanent setbacks\n\n**High Agency vs. Low Agency Thinking**:\n\n| Low Agency | High Agency |\n|------------|-------------|\n| \"I can't because...\" | \"How might I...\" |\n| \"They won't let me\" | \"Let me try and see\" |\n| \"It's always been done this way\" | \"What if we tried...\" |\n| \"I need permission\" | \"Easier to ask forgiveness\" |\n| \"The system is broken\" | \"What can I change?\" |\n| \"I'm waiting for...\" | \"I'll start with what I have\" |\n\n**Developing High Agency**:\n\n- **Start small**: Build confidence through small wins\n- **Reframe constraints**: Ask \"how might I work around this?\" instead of accepting limitations\n- **Reduce permission-seeking**: For low-stakes decisions, act first\n- **Embrace experimentation**: Treat failures as data\n- **Study high agency role models**: Learn their mental patterns\n- **Question \"can't\"**: Most \"can't\" is really \"won't\" or \"haven't figured out how yet\"\n\n**Caveats**:\n\n- High agency without wisdom can lead to recklessness\n- Some constraints are real and should be respected\n- Collective problems require collective action, not just individual agency\n- High agency can become toxic when it ignores systemic barriers others face\n- Balance agency with humility and awareness of your actual sphere of influence\n\n**In Knowledge Work**:\n\nHigh agency knowledge workers don't wait for the perfect tool, method, or moment. They start with what they have, iterate, and improve. They treat their systems as works in progress, continuously experimenting rather than seeking an ideal solution before beginning.",
