    "summary": "A visual representation of the customer journey from initial awareness to final purchase.",
    "explanation": "A sales funnel maps the stages prospects go through before becoming customers: Awareness, Interest, Decision, and Action (AIDA). The funnel shape reflects reality—many people enter at the top, but fewer convert at each stage. Understanding your funnel helps identify where prospects drop off and what interventions might help. For knowledge workers and creators, the funnel applies to newsletter signups, course purchases, or consulting inquiries. Key metrics include conversion rates between stages, time spent in each stage, and overall funnel velocity. Optimizing each stage compounds results—small improvements at the top multiply through the entire funnel.",
