    "name": "Side Project",
    "summary": "A project pursued outside of main work for learning, creativity, income potential, or personal fulfillment.",
    "explanation": "A side project is work undertaken outside of your primary job or responsibilities, typically driven by personal interest, curiosity, or entrepreneurial ambition. Side projects serve multiple purposes and can evolve in unexpected directions.\n\n**Why Side Projects Matter:**\n\n1. **Skill development**: Learn new technologies, domains, or approaches risk-free\n2. **Creative outlet**: Explore ideas without corporate constraints\n3. **Income diversification**: Build potential revenue streams\n4. **Career optionality**: Create paths to new opportunities\n5. **Personal fulfillment**: Work on what genuinely excites you\n\n**Types of Side Projects:**\n\n- **Learning projects**: Built primarily to master new skills\n- **Passion projects**: Driven by personal interest regardless of commercial potential\n- **Entrepreneurial projects**: Intended to become businesses or generate income\n- **Portfolio projects**: Showcase work for career advancement\n- **Open source contributions**: Give back to communities while building reputation\n\n**The Side Project Mindset:**\n\n- Start small and ship fast\n- Embrace imperfection\n- Time-box your investment\n- Share your work publicly\n- Be patient - compound growth takes time\n- Learn to say no to scope creep\n\n**Common Paths:**\n\nMany successful businesses started as side projects: Gmail, Craigslist, Twitter, and countless indie products. However, most side projects don't become businesses - and that's okay. The learning, creativity, and enjoyment have value in themselves.\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n- Finding time alongside main responsibilities\n- Maintaining momentum over months or years\n- Avoiding over-commitment\n- Balancing multiple projects\n- Deciding when to quit vs. persevere",
