    "summary": "Human-AI collaboration where humans and AI work as partners, each contributing their distinct strengths.",
    "explanation": "The Centaur model describes a collaborative approach where humans and AI systems work together as partners, with each contributing their unique strengths. The term originates from chess, where Garry Kasparov observed that human-computer teams (centaurs) could outperform both humans and computers playing alone.\n\n**The Centaur Principle:**\n\nHumans excel at: strategic thinking, creativity, ethical judgment, contextual understanding, handling novel situations, and asking the right questions.\n\nAI excels at: rapid calculation, pattern recognition in large datasets, consistency, tireless execution, and processing speed.\n\nCombining these creates a hybrid that leverages both strengths while mitigating individual weaknesses.\n\n**Centaur vs Cyborg:**\n\nIn a centaur arrangement, the human retains strategic control and the AI serves as a powerful tool. The human decides when and how to use AI assistance. In a cyborg arrangement, the integration is deeper - AI augments human cognition in real-time with less explicit handoff.\n\n**Applications:**\n\n- **Medical diagnosis**: AI suggests possibilities, doctors make final calls\n- **Legal research**: AI surfaces relevant cases, lawyers build arguments\n- **Creative work**: AI generates drafts, humans refine and curate\n- **Investment**: AI analyzes data, humans make strategic decisions\n\n**Key Success Factors:**\n\n- Clear division of responsibilities\n- Human maintains oversight and final authority\n- AI outputs are transparent and explainable\n- Workflow designed for collaboration, not replacement\n\nThe centaur model represents a middle path between full automation and purely human work, optimizing for outcomes while preserving human agency.",
