    "explanation": "Focusing is a body-awareness practice developed by Eugene Gendlin based on his research into what makes psychotherapy effective. He discovered that successful therapy clients naturally accessed their \"felt sense\" - and that this skill could be taught.\n\nThe six steps of Focusing:\n\n1. Clearing a space: Set aside all problems and concerns mentally, creating inner spaciousness\n\n2. Felt sense: Choose one issue and sense it as a whole in your body. Not analyzing, just sensing its totality\n\n3. Finding a handle: Let a word, phrase, or image arise that captures the felt sense's quality\n\n4. Resonating: Check the handle against the felt sense. Does it fit? Adjust until there's a match\n\n5. Asking: Ask the felt sense questions: \"What is the crux of this?\" \"What does this need?\" Wait for answers to come from the body, not the mind\n\n6. Receiving: Welcome whatever comes without judgment. Notice any felt shift - the sense of something releasing or moving forward\n\nWhy Focusing works:\n- Bypasses repetitive mental analysis\n- Accesses implicit, bodily knowledge\n- Allows new understanding to emerge\n- Creates felt shifts that indicate real change\n- Integrates body and mind\n\nApplications of Focusing:\n- Personal problem-solving\n- Creative blocks\n- Decision-making\n- Emotional processing\n- Writing and creative work\n- Therapeutic contexts\n\nFocusing differs from meditation (which usually emphasizes non-engagement with content) by actively engaging with the felt sense to allow meaning to unfold. It's not analyzing but sensing and listening to the body's wisdom.",
