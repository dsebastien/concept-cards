    "summary": "Memory for past events, facts, and experiences, encompassing both episodic and semantic memory systems.",
    "explanation": "Retrospective memory refers to memory for information acquired in the past, encompassing the ability to recall events, facts, and experiences that have already occurred. It is the counterpart to prospective memory (remembering to do things in the future) and represents what most people think of when they hear the word 'memory.'\n\n**Two Major Subsystems**:\n\n1. **Episodic memory**: Personal recollections of specific events, including their context (when, where, how). For example, remembering your first day at a new job or what you had for dinner last night.\n\n2. **Semantic memory**: General knowledge and facts about the world that are not tied to specific personal experiences. For example, knowing that Paris is the capital of France or that water freezes at 0°C.\n\n**How Retrospective Memory Works**:\n\n- **Encoding**: Information enters memory through attention and processing\n- **Consolidation**: Memories are stabilized and integrated with existing knowledge, often during sleep\n- **Storage**: Information is maintained in neural networks distributed across the brain\n- **Retrieval**: Memories are reconstructed (not replayed) using available cues and context\n\n**Key Characteristics**:\n\n- Memories are **reconstructive**, not reproductive—we rebuild memories each time rather than playing back a recording\n- Memory is **context-dependent**: retrieval is easier when the recall context matches the encoding context\n- **Emotional intensity** enhances memory formation but can also distort accuracy\n- Memories **decay over time** following predictable patterns (the forgetting curve)\n\n**Improving Retrospective Memory**:\n\n- **Spaced repetition**: Reviewing material at increasing intervals strengthens long-term retention\n- **Retrieval practice**: Actively recalling information is more effective than re-reading\n- **Elaborative encoding**: Connecting new information to existing knowledge creates stronger memories\n- **Sleep**: Adequate sleep is essential for memory consolidation\n- **External systems**: Notes, journals, and knowledge management systems serve as extensions of biological memory\n\n**Relationship to Knowledge Management**:\n\nPersonal knowledge management systems fundamentally serve as augmentation for retrospective memory. By externalizing knowledge into notes, databases, and linked references, we create reliable retrieval systems that compensate for the natural limitations and biases of biological memory.",
