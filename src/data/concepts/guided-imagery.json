    "summary": "Relaxation technique using directed mental visualization of peaceful scenes to reduce stress and promote healing.",
    "explanation": "Guided Imagery is a mind-body technique that uses directed imagination to evoke sensory experiences that promote relaxation, reduce stress, and support healing. By vividly imagining peaceful scenes or positive outcomes, you can influence your physical and emotional state.\n\nHow Guided Imagery works: The brain doesn't fully distinguish between vividly imagined experiences and real ones. When you imagine a peaceful beach scene, your nervous system responds as if you were actually there - heart rate slows, muscles relax, stress hormones decrease. This mind-body connection makes imagination a powerful tool for change.\n\nTypes of Guided Imagery:\n\n1. Relaxation imagery: Visualizing peaceful natural settings (beach, forest, mountain meadow)\n2. Healing imagery: Imagining the body healing or immune cells fighting illness\n3. Performance imagery: Mentally rehearsing successful outcomes\n4. Process imagery: Visualizing step-by-step completion of goals\n5. End-state imagery: Imagining having already achieved a goal\n\nKey elements for effective practice:\n- Engage all senses (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste)\n- Make images vivid and detailed\n- Include positive emotions\n- Practice regularly in a quiet space\n- Use recorded scripts or guides initially\n\nApplications: Stress reduction, pain management, anxiety relief, sleep improvement, athletic performance, medical procedures, creativity enhancement.\n\nGuided Imagery differs from visualization (which is typically self-directed) by usually following a narrative or script, often with a guide or recording.",
