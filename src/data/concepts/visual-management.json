    "explanation": "Visual Management is a lean management technique that uses visual signals to communicate information quickly and clearly. The goal is to make the current state of work immediately visible to anyone, without requiring verbal explanation or system access.\n\n**Core Principles**:\n- **Visibility**: Information should be seen from a distance\n- **Clarity**: Status should be understood in seconds\n- **Currency**: Displays must reflect real-time state\n- **Accessibility**: Anyone should be able to read and understand\n\n**Common Visual Management Tools**:\n- **Kanban boards**: Work items moving through stages\n- **Andon lights**: Red/yellow/green status indicators\n- **Burn-down charts**: Progress toward goals over time\n- **Dashboards**: Key metrics displayed prominently\n- **Floor markings**: Physical space organization\n- **Shadow boards**: Tool organization showing what's missing\n\n**Benefits**:\n- Immediate status awareness without meetings\n- Quick identification of problems and blockers\n- Shared understanding across team members\n- Reduced need for status reports and check-ins\n- Encourages accountability and ownership\n- Supports continuous improvement by making issues visible\n\n**In PKM Context**:\nVisual management principles apply to personal productivity through:\n- Visual task boards (personal kanban)\n- Habit trackers and streak displays\n- Progress visualizations for goals\n- Calendar blocking for time visibility\n- Dashboard views in note-taking apps\n\nThe key insight is that what you can see, you can manage. Making work visible is the first step to improving it.",
