    "name": "Attention as Currency",
    "summary": "Viewing attention as a limited resource that can be spent, invested, or wasted.",
    "explanation": "Attention as currency is a mental model treating attention as a finite resource to be allocated deliberately - like money. Every attention decision is a spending choice: giving attention to one thing means not giving it to another. This framing helps: recognize the true cost of 'free' content (you pay with attention), evaluate attention investments (what return do I get?), and protect attention like you'd protect money. Like currency, attention can be: spent wisely or wasted, invested for future returns, or stolen/extracted by others. Unlike money, attention can't be saved - each moment's attention is use-it-or-lose-it. The currency metaphor suggests practices like: attention budgeting (allocating attention deliberately), attention ROI (evaluating attention investments), and attention protection (guarding against theft). For knowledge workers, treating attention as currency means: making explicit allocation decisions, recognizing opportunity costs, and valuing attention at its true worth.",
