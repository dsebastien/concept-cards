    "summary": "Leveraging individuals with engaged audiences to promote products or brands to their followers.",
    "explanation": "Influencer marketing borrows trust and attention from people who've built audiences in specific niches. It ranges from mega-influencers (millions of followers, celebrity status) to micro-influencers (thousands of followers, high engagement). Effective influencer partnerships match brand values with influencer authenticity—forced promotions fail. Formats include sponsored posts, reviews, affiliate arrangements, brand ambassadorships, and co-created content. Success metrics include reach, engagement, traffic, and conversions. For creators and businesses, working with influencers can accelerate awareness and credibility in new audiences. As a creator, you might both work with influencers and become one—using your own influence to monetize through partnerships.",
