    "summary": "The practice of defining and structuring a problem clearly before attempting to solve it, ensuring effort is directed at the right issue.",
    "explanation": "Problem framing is the critical first step in any problem-solving process: defining what the problem actually is before jumping to solutions. How a problem is framed determines what solutions are considered, what data is gathered, and ultimately whether the real issue gets addressed. A poorly framed problem leads to solving the wrong thing, while a well-framed problem often makes the solution obvious.\n\n**Why problem framing matters**:\n\n- Most problem-solving failures come from solving the wrong problem, not from wrong solutions\n- The way a problem is stated constrains the solution space\n- Reframing a problem can unlock entirely new approaches\n- Stakeholders often present solutions disguised as problems ('We need a bigger database' vs. 'Queries are slow')\n\n**Problem framing techniques**:\n\n- **Problem statement**: Write a clear, concise description of the gap between current and desired state\n- **5 Whys**: Ask 'why' repeatedly to move from symptoms to root causes\n- **Reframing**: Deliberately state the problem in multiple different ways to see it from different angles\n- **Boundary setting**: Define what is and isn't in scope\n- **Stakeholder mapping**: Identify who is affected and what 'solved' means to each\n- **Assumption surfacing**: Make implicit assumptions explicit and challenge them\n- **Jobs to be done**: Frame the problem in terms of what the user is trying to accomplish\n\n**Common framing mistakes**:\n\n- Jumping to solutions before understanding the problem\n- Framing too narrowly (missing the bigger picture) or too broadly (boiling the ocean)\n- Confusing symptoms with root causes\n- Embedding assumptions in the problem statement\n- Accepting the first framing without exploring alternatives\n- Letting the loudest voice define the problem\n\n**Problem framing in practice**:\n\nEffective problem framers spend a disproportionate amount of time understanding the problem relative to solving it. Albert Einstein reportedly said that if he had an hour to solve a problem, he'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions. While the ratio varies, the principle is sound: invest in understanding before acting.",
