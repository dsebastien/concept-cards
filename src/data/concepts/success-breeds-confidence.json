    "name": "Success Breeds Confidence",
    "summary": "Success creates confidence which leads to more success, while failure can damage confidence and create negativity.",
    "explanation": "Success calls success, but failure can damage your confidence and bring negativity. Success breeds confidence, and confidence breeds success - forming a virtuous circle. But when you fail, it can be hard to get back up. Failure can damage your confidence, and when you are not confident, you are less likely to succeed - forming a vicious circle. Understanding this dynamic is crucial: when stuck in a negative cycle, you need to consciously break it using positive psychology, small wins, and deliberate confidence-building practices.",
