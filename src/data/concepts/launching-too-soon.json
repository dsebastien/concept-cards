    "summary": "The mistake of releasing a product, project, or idea before it meets the minimum threshold of quality needed for success.",
    "explanation": "Launching Too Soon is the flip side of 'Start Before You're Ready.' While starting early is valuable for learning and iteration, launching too soon can damage first impressions, waste opportunities, and create technical or reputational debt that's hard to recover from.\n\n**The Tension:**\n\nThere's a fundamental tension between two valid principles:\n- 'Ship early, iterate often' - learn from real feedback rather than speculation\n- 'You only get one chance at a first impression' - early users form lasting opinions\n\nThe key is recognizing which applies to your situation.\n\n**When Launching Too Soon Hurts:**\n\n1. **First impressions matter disproportionately**: Products reviewed by journalists, investments pitched to VCs, or launches to an audience you can only reach once\n2. **Switching costs are low**: If users can easily try alternatives, a poor first experience sends them to competitors permanently\n3. **Trust is hard to rebuild**: B2B products, financial services, or anything where reliability is the core value proposition\n4. **Network effects work against you**: Early negative reviews or word-of-mouth can create a doom loop\n\n**When Early Launch Is Fine:**\n\n1. **You can iterate with the same users**: Internal tools, communities, or products with captive audiences\n2. **Feedback is more valuable than polish**: You're still validating the core hypothesis\n3. **The audience expects roughness**: Beta programs, early-access communities, or developer tools\n4. **Recovery is cheap**: Low switching costs work both ways—users who leave can return\n\n**Signs You're Launching Too Soon:**\n\n- Core value proposition doesn't work reliably\n- Onboarding is so broken users can't experience the value\n- Critical data could be lost or corrupted\n- You'd be embarrassed to demo it to your target users\n\n**The Minimum Viable Threshold:**\n\nA true MVP isn't the smallest possible thing—it's the smallest thing that delivers the core value proposition reliably enough that users can evaluate whether they want it. Below that threshold, you're not learning about product-market fit; you're just learning that broken things frustrate people.",
