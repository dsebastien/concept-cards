    "name": "Vividness Bias",
    "summary": "The cognitive tendency to judge vivid, emotionally striking, or easily imagined information as more likely, more important, or more true than pallid or abstract information.",
    "explanation": "Vividness bias is the tendency to give disproportionate weight to information that is vivid, concrete, emotionally engaging, or easy to visualize, while underweighting information that is abstract, statistical, or less emotionally salient.\n\nThis bias manifests in several ways:\n\n- **Predictions**: When you can vividly picture something happening ('I can see it now'), it feels more likely to occur, regardless of actual probability.\n- **Risk assessment**: A single vivid news story about a plane crash influences perceived danger more than statistics showing air travel is extraordinarily safe.\n- **Memory**: Dramatic or emotional events are recalled more easily (the availability heuristic), making them seem more common.\n- **Decision-making**: A compelling personal anecdote often outweighs rigorous data in swaying opinions.\n\nThe underlying mechanism is that our brains evolved to respond to concrete, present threats — a growling predator — not to abstract statistical probabilities. Vivid information triggers emotional responses, and we interpret those emotions as evidence of truth or importance.\n\nRecognizing vividness bias is particularly important when:\n\n- Making predictions about the future (the vividness of a mental image says nothing about its likelihood)\n- Evaluating risks (dramatic but rare events feel more dangerous than common but undramatic ones)\n- Assessing the credibility of claims (a good story is not better evidence than good data)",
