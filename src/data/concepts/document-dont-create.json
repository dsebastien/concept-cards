    "summary": "A content strategy focused on documenting your existing work and life rather than creating content from scratch.",
    "explanation": "Document, Don't Create is a content philosophy popularized by Gary Vaynerchuk that reframes content creation. Instead of asking 'What content should I create?', ask 'What am I already doing that's worth documenting?'\n\n**The Core Shift:**\nMost people think content requires performance—sitting down to create something new. But you're already doing interesting things: working on projects, solving problems, learning skills, having conversations. Documentation turns existing activities into content.\n\n**Why It's Easier:**\n- **No blank page problem** - The content already exists\n- **Authentic by default** - You're showing reality, not performing\n- **Sustainable** - You're not adding work, just capturing it\n- **Unique** - Your actual experience is one-of-a-kind\n- **Builds trust** - Audiences see the real you\n\n**What to Document:**\n- Your daily work and processes\n- Problems you solve and how\n- Conversations and meetings (with permission)\n- Behind-the-scenes of projects\n- Your learning journey\n- Wins and failures\n- Decision-making in action\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Identify activities worth capturing\n2. Set up simple capture systems (phone, notes, screen recording)\n3. Extract content from documentation\n4. Repurpose across platforms\n\n**The Mindset:**\nYou don't need a content idea—you need a camera on your life. The interesting moments are already happening; you just need to capture them.\n\n**Caution:**\nDocumentation still requires curation. Not everything is worth sharing. The skill is recognizing which moments have value for others.",
