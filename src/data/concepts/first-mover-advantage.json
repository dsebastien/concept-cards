    "summary": "The competitive benefits gained by being the first to enter a market or introduce a product category.",
    "explanation": "First-mover advantage suggests that pioneers in a market gain lasting benefits: brand recognition and customer loyalty, control over resources and distribution, setting industry standards, and learning curve advantages. However, first-mover advantage isn't automatic—it requires execution and the market being ready. Many first movers fail while fast followers succeed (Google wasn't the first search engine, Facebook wasn't the first social network). First movers bear education costs and make mistakes that followers learn from. The advantage is strongest when there are high switching costs, network effects, or resource control. For creators, being first in a niche can establish authority, but timing and execution matter more than mere priority.",
