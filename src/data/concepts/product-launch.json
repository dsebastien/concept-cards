    "summary": "The coordinated introduction of a new product to the market, designed to maximize initial impact.",
    "explanation": "A product launch is the strategic rollout of a new offering, coordinating messaging, timing, channels, and activities for maximum impact. Launch phases typically include: pre-launch (building anticipation, waitlists, early access), launch (the main event, often with limited-time offers), and post-launch (follow-up, testimonials, iteration). Key elements include: clear positioning and messaging, coordinated marketing across channels, compelling launch offers (bonuses, early pricing), social proof (testimonials, case studies), and urgency mechanics. For creators, launches can generate concentrated revenue through time-limited offers and create momentum through coordinated attention. However, successful launches require: an audience to launch to, a product worth launching, and realistic expectations. Many creators now prefer 'evergreen' approaches over repeated launches.",
