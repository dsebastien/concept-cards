    "summary": "The unequal distribution of knowledge between parties in an interaction or system.",
    "explanation": "Knowledge Asymmetry, also known as information asymmetry in economics, describes the situation where one party in a transaction or interaction possesses more or better knowledge than the other. This imbalance can significantly affect outcomes, decision-making, and the dynamics of relationships.\n\nKnowledge asymmetry manifests in many contexts. Expert-novice gaps are among the most common, where specialists hold deep domain knowledge that newcomers lack. Organizational silos create asymmetry between departments that do not share information effectively. Client-consultant relationships are inherently asymmetric, as consultants possess specialized expertise that clients are paying to access. In buyer-seller dynamics, one side typically knows more about the product's true value or condition.\n\nThe consequences of knowledge asymmetry can be severe. Poor decisions result when one party lacks critical information. Exploitation can occur when the more knowledgeable party takes advantage of the gap, as seen in markets with adverse selection and moral hazard problems. Organizational inefficiency arises when teams duplicate work or miss opportunities because knowledge is trapped in silos.\n\nSeveral strategies can mitigate knowledge asymmetry. Knowledge sharing practices, such as documentation, mentoring, and cross-functional collaboration, help distribute expertise more evenly. Transparency mechanisms, including open communication channels and accessible documentation, reduce information gaps. Training and education programs systematically close the knowledge gap between experts and newcomers.\n\nKnowledge asymmetry is closely related to the curse of knowledge bias, where experts struggle to communicate effectively with non-experts because they cannot easily imagine what it is like not to know something. Recognizing and addressing knowledge asymmetry is essential for building healthier organizations, fairer markets, and more effective communication.",
