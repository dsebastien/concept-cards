    "summary": "Attributes that allow an organization to outperform its competitors in the marketplace.",
    "explanation": "Competitive advantage refers to the factors that allow a company to produce goods or services better or more cheaply than rivals, leading to superior profitability. Michael Porter identified two basic types: cost advantage (producing at lower cost than competitors) and differentiation advantage (offering unique value that commands premium prices). Sources of competitive advantage include: proprietary technology, strong brand, economies of scale, network effects, exclusive access to resources, and organizational capabilities. Sustainable competitive advantage requires that advantages be valuable, rare, difficult to imitate, and organizationally supported (the VRIO framework). Temporary advantages are increasingly common as competition intensifies and imitation accelerates. For knowledge workers, competitive advantage applies personally - what unique combination of skills, knowledge, and relationships makes you valuable? Building and maintaining competitive advantage requires continuous investment and adaptation.",
