    "summary": "The capacity for self-governance and independent decision-making, recognized as a fundamental psychological need for well-being and motivation.",
    "explanation": "Autonomy is the quality of being self-governing—having the freedom and capacity to make choices aligned with one's own values and interests. In psychology, particularly Self-Determination Theory (SDT), autonomy is identified as one of three basic psychological needs (alongside competence and relatedness) essential for intrinsic motivation, well-being, and optimal functioning.\n\n**What Autonomy Is (and Isn't)**:\n\nAutonomy doesn't mean isolation or complete independence from others. Rather, it's about:\n\n- **Volition**: Acting from choice rather than coercion\n- **Self-endorsement**: Identifying with and owning your actions\n- **Authenticity**: Behavior aligned with your values\n- **Agency**: Feeling like the author of your actions\n\nYou can be autonomously interdependent—freely choosing to collaborate or follow others' guidance.\n\n**Autonomy in Self-Determination Theory**:\n\nSDT distinguishes:\n\n- **Autonomous motivation**: Acting because you find something interesting, important, or aligned with your values\n- **Controlled motivation**: Acting due to external pressure, rewards, or internal guilt\n\nAutonomous motivation leads to better performance, persistence, creativity, and well-being.\n\n**Supporting Autonomy**:\n\nFor yourself:\n- Identify and act on personal values\n- Make conscious choices rather than defaulting\n- Reduce unnecessary obligations\n- Build skills that expand options\n\nFor others:\n- Provide choice where possible\n- Explain rationale rather than just giving orders\n- Acknowledge feelings and perspectives\n- Minimize controlling language (\"you must,\" \"you should\")\n\n**Autonomy in Knowledge Work**:\n\nIn personal knowledge management, autonomy manifests as:\n\n- Choosing your own tools and methods\n- Deciding what's worth capturing and learning\n- Structuring information in ways that make sense to you\n- Resisting one-size-fits-all productivity advice\n\n**Tensions and Balance**:\n\nAutonomy must balance with:\n\n- **Collaboration**: Working with others requires some coordination\n- **Expertise**: Sometimes deferring to others' judgment is wise\n- **Responsibility**: Freedom comes with accountability\n- **Reality**: Not all constraints can be removed",
