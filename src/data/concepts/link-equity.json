    "summary": "The value or authority that a hyperlink passes from one page to another, influencing search engine rankings.",
    "explanation": "Link equity (historically called \"link juice\") is the SEO value transferred from one page to another through hyperlinks. When a page with authority links to another page, it passes a portion of that authority along. This concept is the foundation of how search engines determine page importance and rankings.\n\nHow link equity flows:\n\n- A page's equity is divided among all its outbound links\n- More links on a page means less equity per link\n- Links from high-authority pages pass more equity\n- Links from topically relevant pages carry more weight\n- First links on a page may carry more weight than subsequent ones\n\nFactors that affect link equity:\n\n- **Authority of the linking page**: A link from a DA 80 site passes more equity than from a DA 20 site\n- **Relevance**: Links from topically related pages pass more contextual equity\n- **Link placement**: Editorial links within content pass more equity than footer or sidebar links\n- **Anchor text**: The clickable text provides topical signals about the target page\n- **Follow status**: Nofollow, sponsored, and UGC attributes tell search engines not to pass equity\n- **Redirects**: 301 redirects pass most equity; chains and 302s may dilute it\n\nInternal vs external equity:\n\n- External links from other domains build overall site authority\n- Internal links distribute existing equity to important pages within the site\n- Strategic internal linking can concentrate equity on pages you want to rank\n\nLink equity explains why link building is a core SEO strategy and why internal linking architecture matters. Pages that accumulate more equity from quality sources tend to rank higher for competitive terms.",
