    "explanation": "Closing is the culmination of the sales process—asking for the business. Classic techniques include: the assumptive close (proceeding as if they've decided), the alternative close (offering choices that both lead to yes), the urgency close (time-limited offers), the summary close (recapping benefits before asking), and the question close (asking if there's any reason not to proceed). Modern approaches emphasize that closing should feel natural when qualification and value demonstration are done well—it's simply the logical next step. Pushy closing damages trust; confident closing serves customers ready to decide. For creators, closing happens in sales pages, webinars, emails, and calls—each context requires adapted techniques.",
