    "summary": "Working effectively with others across geographic distance using digital tools and practices.",
    "explanation": "Remote collaboration involves working productively with team members who are not physically co-located, using digital tools and adapted practices. Key challenges include: reduced informal communication, time zone coordination, technology dependence, and maintaining team cohesion. Effective remote collaboration requires: intentional communication (over-communicating context that would be obvious in person), documentation (writing decisions and context), appropriate tools (video, chat, project management), and relationship building (virtual social time). Successful remote teams often: default to async where possible, reserve sync time for high-value interactions, create documentation culture, and invest extra effort in onboarding. Benefits include: access to broader talent, reduced commute, flexibility, and focused work time. Challenges include: isolation, work-life boundary blur, and reduced serendipitous connection. For knowledge workers, remote collaboration skills are increasingly essential as distributed work becomes more common.",
