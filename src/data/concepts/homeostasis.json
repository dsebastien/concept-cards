    "summary": "The tendency of biological and organizational systems to maintain internal stability through self-regulating feedback mechanisms.",
    "explanation": "Homeostasis is the property of a system to regulate its internal environment and maintain a stable, relatively constant condition. The term was coined by physiologist Walter Bradford Cannon in 1926, derived from Greek words meaning 'similar' and 'standing still'.\n\n## How it works\n\nHomeostatic systems use negative feedback loops to counteract disturbances:\n\n1. **Sensor** detects a change from the set point\n2. **Control center** evaluates the deviation\n3. **Effector** takes action to restore equilibrium\n4. **Feedback** confirms the correction\n\n## Biological examples\n\n- **Body temperature** - Shivering when cold, sweating when hot to maintain ~37C\n- **Blood sugar** - Insulin and glucagon regulate glucose levels\n- **Blood pressure** - Heart rate and vessel dilation adjust to maintain pressure\n- **pH balance** - Kidneys and lungs maintain blood pH near 7.4\n- **Hydration** - Thirst signals drive water intake when dehydrated\n\n## Homeostasis in organizations\n\nOrganizations exhibit homeostatic behavior:\n\n- **Cultural homeostasis** - Organizations resist changes to established norms and values\n- **Process homeostasis** - Workflows tend to return to established patterns after disruption\n- **Budget homeostasis** - Departments protect existing budgets regardless of changing needs\n- **Team composition** - Groups resist changes to membership and roles\n\nThis explains why organizational change is so difficult - the system actively resists deviation from its current state.\n\n## Homeostasis in personal change\n\nIndividuals experience homeostasis in behavior change:\n\n- **Comfort zone maintenance** - The body and mind resist leaving familiar patterns\n- **Weight set point theory** - The body tends to defend a particular weight range\n- **Identity protection** - Self-concept resists changes that conflict with 'who I am'\n- **Habit resistance** - Established neural pathways resist new behaviors\n\nThis is why new habits feel uncomfortable initially and why people often revert to old behaviors - the system is trying to restore its previous equilibrium.\n\n## Implications\n\n1. **Change requires sustained pressure** - Brief interventions rarely overcome homeostatic resistance\n2. **The new state must become the set point** - Success means establishing a new equilibrium\n3. **Gradual change is often more sustainable** - Small shifts in the set point are easier to maintain than dramatic leaps\n4. **External support helps** - Accountability, environment design, and social support counteract homeostatic pull\n5. **Expect resistance** - It's not a sign of failure; it's the system working as designed\n\n## Connection to systems thinking\n\nHomeostasis is a specific case of negative (balancing) feedback in systems theory. Understanding homeostasis helps explain why systems resist change and how to design interventions that create lasting shifts rather than temporary perturbations.",
