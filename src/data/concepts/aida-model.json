    "summary": "A classic marketing framework describing the stages of customer engagement: Attention, Interest, Desire, Action.",
    "explanation": "AIDA is one of the oldest and most enduring marketing frameworks, dating back to 1898. It describes the cognitive stages a customer goes through when making a purchase decision. First, you must capture Attention in a crowded marketplace. Then, sustain their Interest by demonstrating relevance to their needs. Next, create Desire by connecting emotionally and showing benefits. Finally, prompt Action with a clear call to action. For content creators and knowledge workers, AIDA applies to writing headlines, structuring articles, crafting emails, and designing landing pages. Each stage requires different techniques—attention might need novelty, while desire requires social proof and emotion.",
