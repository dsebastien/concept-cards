    "summary": "The highest level of reading that involves reading multiple books on the same subject to construct an analysis that may not be found in any single source.",
    "explanation": "Syntopical Reading, also called comparative reading, is the fourth and highest level of reading described by Mortimer Adler in 'How to Read a Book.' It goes beyond understanding a single book to synthesizing knowledge across multiple sources on the same topic.\n\nThe process involves five key steps: **Finding relevant passages** across multiple books that address your question. **Bringing authors to terms** by establishing a neutral vocabulary since different authors use different terminology. **Getting the questions clear** by framing questions that all authors can be interpreted as answering, even if they didn't explicitly ask them. **Defining the issues** by recognizing where authors agree, disagree, or address different aspects. **Analyzing the discussion** by ordering the issues and questions to shed maximum light on the subject.\n\nSyntopical reading is the most demanding but also most rewarding form of reading. Unlike analytical reading which aims to understand what an author says, syntopical reading aims to understand a subject itself by triangulating across multiple perspectives. The reader becomes an active participant in creating knowledge rather than just receiving it.\n\nThis approach is essential for researchers, scholars, and anyone tackling complex questions where no single authority has the complete answer. It's the foundation of serious intellectual work and forms the basis of how doctoral dissertations and literature reviews are conducted. The goal is not to summarize what others have said, but to construct your own understanding that transcends any single source.",
