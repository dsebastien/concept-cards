    "name": "Span of Control",
    "summary": "The number of subordinates a manager can effectively supervise, typically ranging from 3 to 15 depending on context.",
    "explanation": "Span of control (also called span of management) refers to the number of direct reports a single manager can effectively oversee. It is a fundamental concept in organizational design that directly influences hierarchy depth, communication patterns, and management effectiveness.\n\n**Historical context:**\n\nThe concept was formalized by management theorists like V.A. Graicunas (1933) and Lyndall Urwick, who originally suggested an ideal span of 5-6 direct reports. Modern thinking recognizes that optimal span varies significantly by context.\n\n**Factors affecting optimal span:**\n\n- **Task complexity**: Routine work allows wider spans; complex knowledge work requires narrower spans\n- **Team maturity**: Experienced, self-managing teams can operate with wider spans\n- **Geographic distribution**: Remote/distributed teams may need narrower spans\n- **Manager capability**: More skilled managers can handle wider spans\n- **Organizational support**: Good tools and processes enable wider spans\n- **Standardization**: Highly standardized work needs less direct supervision\n\n**Narrow span (3-5):**\n- More management layers (tall hierarchy)\n- Closer supervision and mentoring\n- Higher management cost\n- Slower communication through more layers\n\n**Wide span (10-15+):**\n- Fewer management layers (flat hierarchy)\n- More autonomy for team members\n- Lower management overhead\n- Risk of manager overwhelm and neglect\n\n**Modern trends:**\n\nOrganizations increasingly favor wider spans to create flatter structures, reduce bureaucracy, and empower employees. Tech companies like Google have experimented with spans of 20+ for engineering managers. However, wider spans require strong delegation skills, clear processes, and self-directed team members.\n\nThe right span is not a fixed number but depends on the interplay between task demands, team capabilities, and organizational context.",
