    "summary": "The principle that decisions should be made at the lowest competent organizational level, closest to those affected.",
    "explanation": "Subsidiarity is a governance principle stating that matters should be handled by the smallest, lowest, or least centralized authority capable of addressing them effectively. A higher-level body should only intervene when a lower-level entity cannot adequately manage the task on its own.\n\n**Origins:**\n\nThe concept has roots in Catholic social teaching (notably Pope Pius XI's 1931 encyclical *Quadragesimo Anno*) and has been adopted widely in political science, organizational design, and management theory. It is a foundational principle of the European Union, enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon.\n\n**Core idea:**\n\nCentralization should be the exception, not the rule. People closest to a problem usually understand it best and can respond most effectively. Higher authorities should support and enable lower-level decision-making rather than replace it.\n\n**In organizational contexts:**\n\n- Teams should decide their own working processes\n- Local managers should handle local issues\n- Corporate headquarters should only intervene on truly organization-wide matters\n- Individual contributors should have authority over their domain of expertise\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n- Faster decision-making (no waiting for distant authorities)\n- Better decisions (closer to relevant information)\n- Greater engagement and ownership\n- Reduced bureaucratic bottleneck\n- More adaptive and resilient organizations\n\n**Tensions:**\n\n- Requires trust in lower-level competence\n- Can create inconsistency across units\n- Needs clear boundaries about what constitutes 'competent'\n- Must balance local autonomy with organizational coherence\n\nSubsidiarity is the philosophical foundation behind delegation frameworks, self-organizing teams, and decentralized organizational structures.",
