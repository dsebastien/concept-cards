    "summary": "Self-education without formal instruction - learning on your own initiative and direction.",
    "explanation": "Autodidacticism is the practice of self-education without formal teachers or institutions. Autodidacts teach themselves using books, online resources, experimentation, observation, and mentorship they seek out themselves. Famous autodidacts include Leonardo da Vinci, Benjamin Franklin, Abraham Lincoln, and many successful entrepreneurs and creators. In the modern era with abundant free learning resources, autodidacticism is increasingly viable and valuable. Key autodidact skills include: curiosity, persistence, resource identification, self-assessment, and the ability to structure learning without external scaffolding. Challenges include: knowing what you don't know, avoiding blind spots, staying motivated without external accountability, and getting feedback. For knowledge workers, developing autodidact capabilities complements formal education and ensures you can learn whatever you need throughout your career. PKM systems support autodidacticism by organizing learning resources and tracking progress.",
