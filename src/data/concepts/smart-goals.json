    "summary": "Goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.",
    "explanation": "SMART Goals is a framework for setting effective goals. Goals should be: Specific (clearly defined), Measurable (quantifiable progress), Achievable (realistic given resources), Relevant (aligned with larger objectives), and Time-bound (with deadlines). Vague goals like 'get better at writing' become SMART: 'Publish one blog post per week for the next 3 months.' SMART criteria transform wishes into actionable commitments with clear success criteria.",
