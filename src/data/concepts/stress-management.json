    "explanation": "Stress Management encompasses the techniques, strategies, and lifestyle changes used to control stress levels and reduce its negative effects. Effective stress management doesn't mean eliminating stress (which is impossible and sometimes undesirable) but developing resilience and tools to handle it skillfully.\n\nThe stress management toolkit:\n\n1. Physiological techniques:\n   - Breathing exercises (box breathing, 4-7-8, diaphragmatic)\n   - Progressive muscle relaxation\n   - Exercise and physical activity\n   - Sleep optimization\n   - Nutrition and hydration\n\n2. Psychological techniques:\n   - Cognitive reframing (changing how you think about stressors)\n   - Mindfulness and meditation\n   - Journaling and expressive writing\n   - Therapy and counseling\n   - Stress mindset cultivation (seeing stress as enhancing vs. debilitating)\n\n3. Behavioral techniques:\n   - Time management and prioritization\n   - Boundary setting\n   - Social support cultivation\n   - Hobby engagement\n   - Nature exposure\n\n4. Environmental modifications:\n   - Workspace organization\n   - Noise management\n   - Technology boundaries\n   - Creating calm spaces\n\nKey principles:\n- Prevention over cure (build resilience before crisis)\n- Multiple modalities (combine physical, mental, social approaches)\n- Regular practice (not just during emergencies)\n- Personalization (what works varies by individual)\n\nFor knowledge workers: Stress management is not optional. Chronic stress impairs memory, creativity, decision-making, and health. Building a personal stress management practice is a professional competency.",
