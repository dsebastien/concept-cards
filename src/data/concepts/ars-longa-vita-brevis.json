    "summary": "The Latin phrase meaning 'art is long, life is short' - the contrast between craft and mortality.",
    "explanation": "Ars longa, vita brevis (Latin translation of a Greek aphorism by Hippocrates) means 'art is long, life is short.' The original medical context noted that mastering the healing art takes longer than a single lifetime. The wisdom highlights: the vastness of skill and knowledge versus limited time, the importance of starting despite never completing, and the value of contributing to ongoing endeavors. The phrase inspires: beginning important work now (time is limited), accepting incomplete mastery (perfection is impossible), and contributing to traditions larger than oneself. It also provides perspective: individual life is brief but contributes to something enduring. The concept connects to: craft traditions (passed through generations), cumulative knowledge (building on predecessors), and legacy (contributing beyond one's life). The tension it names is: the desire to master versus time's constraint, and the resolution is purposeful engagement despite incompleteness. For knowledge workers, the phrase suggests: starting important projects now, accepting lifelong learning as unfinishable, and contributing to fields that outlast individuals.",
