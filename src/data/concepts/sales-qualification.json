    "summary": "The process of determining whether a prospect is likely to become a customer.",
    "explanation": "Sales qualification helps focus time and resources on prospects most likely to buy. Popular frameworks include BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline), MEDDIC (Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Identify Pain, Champion), and CHAMP (Challenges, Authority, Money, Prioritization). Effective qualification answers: Does the prospect have the problem we solve? Can they afford our solution? Who makes the decision? What's their timeline? Disqualifying poor fits early prevents wasted effort and improves win rates. For creators and knowledge workers, qualification might mean identifying who's ready to invest in transformation versus who's just curious—focusing energy on serious prospects rather than trying to convince everyone.",
