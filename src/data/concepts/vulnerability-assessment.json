    "summary": "The systematic process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing security weaknesses in systems.",
    "explanation": "Vulnerability assessment is a systematic examination of security weaknesses in an information system. It evaluates whether the system is susceptible to known vulnerabilities, assigns severity levels to identified weaknesses, and recommends remediation or mitigation steps. Unlike penetration testing, which attempts to exploit vulnerabilities, vulnerability assessment focuses on identification and classification without active exploitation.\n\nThe vulnerability assessment process typically involves several phases: asset discovery identifies all systems, applications, and devices in scope; vulnerability scanning uses automated tools to detect known security weaknesses; analysis validates findings and eliminates false positives; risk rating prioritizes vulnerabilities based on factors like exploitability, potential impact, and asset criticality; and reporting documents findings with remediation recommendations.\n\nVulnerability scanners are essential tools in this process, maintaining databases of known vulnerabilities and checking systems against them. Common scanning types include network vulnerability scans, web application scans, database scans, and host-based assessments. Results are often mapped to frameworks like the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) for standardized severity ratings.\n\nEffective vulnerability management extends beyond one-time assessments to continuous processes. Organizations should establish regular scanning schedules, integrate vulnerability data with asset management and threat intelligence, define clear remediation SLAs based on severity, and track metrics to measure program effectiveness over time.\n\nVulnerability assessment complements other security activities. It provides input for penetration testing by identifying targets, informs patch management priorities, supports compliance requirements, and feeds risk management decisions. However, it's important to recognize that vulnerability scanning alone cannot identify all weaknesses, particularly those requiring business logic understanding or novel attack techniques.",
