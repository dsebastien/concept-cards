    "explanation": "The Feynman Technique is a learning method named after physicist Richard Feynman that involves explaining concepts in simple terms as if teaching a child. The four steps are: 1) Choose a concept, 2) Explain it in simple language, 3) Identify gaps in your understanding, 4) Review and simplify further. If you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it well enough. Writing about a topic helps uncover gaps in understanding. This technique is powerful for deepening comprehension and revealing what you truly know.",
