    "name": "Net Negatives",
    "summary": "Elements in life (activities, relationships, commitments) that subtract more value, energy, or happiness than they provide, leaving you worse off.",
    "explanation": "Net negatives are the activities, relationships, commitments, habits, and possessions that cost you more than they give back. They drain your time, energy, money, or emotional well-being while providing insufficient value in return. Unlike trade-offs where you sacrifice something for a greater gain, net negatives leave you with a deficit. Examples include toxic relationships that erode your self-worth, subscriptions you never use, meetings that accomplish nothing, habits that harm your health, and commitments made out of obligation rather than genuine interest.\n\nIdentifying net negatives requires honest self-assessment. Track how different elements of your life affect your energy levels, emotional state, and progress toward your goals. Pay attention to what consistently leaves you feeling drained, resentful, or stuck. Ask yourself: Does this activity energize or deplete me? Does this relationship support my growth or hold me back? Does this commitment align with my values and priorities? The answers often reveal patterns of obligation and habit rather than conscious choice.\n\nWe hold onto net negatives for many reasons. Sunk cost fallacy makes us reluctant to abandon what we've already invested in. Guilt and social pressure keep us in relationships and commitments that no longer serve us. Habit makes the familiar feel necessary even when it's harmful. Fear of the void makes us prefer a known negative to an unknown alternative. Yet research consistently shows that eliminating negatives often improves well-being more than adding positives. Removing a draining commitment frees up energy, time, and mental space that can naturally flow toward what matters. The practice of identifying and removing net negatives is a form of life editing that creates room for genuine value to emerge.",
