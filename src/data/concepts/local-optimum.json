    "summary": "A solution that is best within a limited neighborhood but not the globally best solution.",
    "explanation": "A local optimum (or local maximum/minimum) is a solution that appears optimal when compared only to nearby alternatives, but may not be the best solution globally. It's like finding the top of a small hill while missing the mountain nearby.\n\nThis concept is critical in:\n\n**Decision-making**: We often settle for \"good enough\" solutions because we only compare them to slight variations, missing radically different approaches that would be far better.\n\n**Career and life**: People stay in suboptimal jobs, relationships, or cities because they're the best option they can see from their current position. Making a big change (exploration) might reveal much better options.\n\n**Business**: Companies optimize their current products incrementally while competitors create entirely new categories.\n\n**Learning**: Mastering one technique can prevent discovering better methods—the competence trap.\n\nEscaping local optima requires:\n- **Exploration**: Trying random or different approaches\n- **Big jumps**: Making significant changes rather than incremental tweaks\n- **Fresh perspectives**: Getting outside viewpoints\n- **Deliberate experimentation**: Systematically testing alternatives\n\nThe exploration vs exploitation tradeoff is fundamentally about balancing the safety of exploiting known local optima against the risk and potential reward of exploring for global optima.",
