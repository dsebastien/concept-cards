    "explanation": "Email marketing remains one of the highest-ROI marketing channels because you own the relationship—no algorithm decides who sees your content. Effective email marketing includes: building a quality list (not buying), segmenting based on interests or behavior, providing consistent value (not just promotions), writing compelling subject lines, and optimizing send times. Key metrics include open rate, click rate, and conversion rate. Types of emails include newsletters, nurture sequences, promotional campaigns, and transactional emails. For creators and knowledge workers, email is often the primary revenue channel—your list is your most valuable asset. The principle 'give, give, give, ask' ensures you provide value before requesting action.",
