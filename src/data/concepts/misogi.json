    "summary": "A Japanese-inspired practice of undertaking one extremely challenging endeavor per year to push personal limits and create a defining experience.",
    "explanation": "Misogi is a practice rooted in Japanese Shinto tradition, originally referring to ritual purification under a waterfall. In its modern personal development context, popularized by Marcus Elliott and Kyle Korver, Misogi refers to taking on one nearly impossible physical or mental challenge per year — something with a roughly 50% chance of failure that pushes you far beyond your comfort zone.\n\n## The Rules of Misogi\n\nThe modern practice follows two simple rules:\n\n1. **It must be really, really hard** — the challenge should push you to your absolute limit, with a genuine chance of failure. If success is guaranteed, it's not a Misogi.\n2. **You don't talk about it** — the experience is for personal growth, not for social media or bragging rights. The value comes from the internal transformation, not external validation.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nMisogi serves several purposes:\n\n- **Resetting your baseline**: By voluntarily facing extreme difficulty, everyday challenges feel more manageable in contrast\n- **Discovering hidden capacity**: You learn that you're capable of far more than you thought, which builds lasting self-efficacy\n- **Creating a defining memory**: A Misogi becomes a reference point — a year-anchoring experience that you carry forward\n- **Building mental toughness**: The practice develops resilience, grit, and the ability to perform under pressure\n- **Combating complacency**: It prevents the drift into comfortable routines that stop challenging growth\n\n## Examples\n\n- Swimming across a large body of open water\n- Completing an ultra-marathon or multi-day endurance event\n- A solo multi-day wilderness trek with minimal gear\n- Climbing a significant mountain\n- A 24-hour or 48-hour fast combined with physical challenge\n- Any endeavor that is deeply personal and genuinely daunting\n\n## Connection to Other Frameworks\n\nMisogi is the inspiration behind the \"1\" in Jesse Itzler's 1-6-4 Method — the year-making event. It also connects to the Stoic practice of voluntary discomfort (as advocated by Seneca), the concept of hormesis (stress that produces growth), and the idea that growth happens at the edge of one's comfort zone. The practice embodies the principle that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger — but applied deliberately and wisely rather than recklessly.",
