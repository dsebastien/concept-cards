    "summary": "A metric measuring the average revenue generated per user over a specific time period.",
    "explanation": "Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) measures the average revenue generated by each user or customer over a defined period (typically monthly or annually). It's a key metric for subscription businesses, telecom companies, and any business with a user base.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nARPU = Total Revenue / Number of Users\n\n**Monthly ARPU:**\nMonthly ARPU = Monthly Revenue / Average Monthly Users\n\n**Example:**\nIf a SaaS company generates $100,000 in monthly revenue from 2,000 users:\nARPU = $100,000 / 2,000 = $50/user/month\n\n**ARPU variants:**\n\n- **ARPA**: Average Revenue Per Account (B2B)\n- **ARPPU**: Average Revenue Per Paying User (freemium)\n- **ARPDAU**: Average Revenue Per Daily Active User (mobile games)\n\n**Why ARPU matters:**\n\n1. **Pricing validation**: Shows if pricing captures value\n2. **Segment analysis**: Compare user cohorts\n3. **Growth tracking**: Monitor monetization over time\n4. **Benchmarking**: Compare against industry peers\n5. **Unit economics**: Foundation for LTV calculations\n\n**Factors affecting ARPU:**\n\n- Pricing tiers and structure\n- Upsell/cross-sell effectiveness\n- User mix (free vs paid)\n- Add-on adoption\n- Geographic distribution\n- Customer segment mix\n\n**Strategies to increase ARPU:**\n\n1. **Optimize pricing**: Test higher prices, value-based pricing\n2. **Upselling**: Move users to higher tiers\n3. **Cross-selling**: Add complementary products\n4. **Reduce discounting**: Maintain price integrity\n5. **Add premium features**: Create upgrade incentives\n6. **Usage-based pricing**: Capture value from heavy users\n\n**ARPU in different industries:**\n\n- SaaS: $50-$500+/month (varies widely)\n- Telecom: $40-$80/month\n- Mobile games: $0.01-$5/month (many free users)\n- Streaming services: $10-$20/month\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n- Can mask segment differences\n- Sensitive to user count methodology\n- Doesn't reflect profitability\n- May not account for user activity\n\n**ARPU vs ARPPU:**\n\nFor freemium businesses, ARPPU (paying users only) is often more meaningful than ARPU (all users), as it shows true monetization of converted users.\n\nARPU is essential for understanding revenue efficiency and making decisions about pricing, product, and growth strategies.",
