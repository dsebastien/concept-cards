    "summary": "Building and running a business entirely by oneself, without employees or co-founders.",
    "explanation": "Solopreneurship is the practice of building and operating a business as a single person, handling all aspects from product development to marketing to customer support. Unlike freelancing, solopreneurs build scalable assets and systems rather than trading time for money.\n\n**The Solopreneur Playbook (Justin Welsh):**\n\n1. **One niche**: Focus on a specific market segment you understand deeply\n2. **1,000 true fans**: Build a dedicated audience who values your work\n3. **One solvable problem**: Identify a clear pain point you can address\n4. **One systematized solution**: Create a repeatable product or service\n5. Everything else is overcomplication\n\n**Key Principles:**\n\n- **Leverage over labor**: Use technology, systems, and content to multiply your output\n- **Productize yourself**: Turn your unique skills and knowledge into scalable offerings\n- **Own your audience**: Build direct relationships through email lists and communities\n- **Stay lean**: Minimize overhead and maximize profit margins\n- **Automate ruthlessly**: Remove yourself from repetitive tasks\n\n**Common Solopreneur Business Models:**\n\n- Digital products (courses, ebooks, templates)\n- Software as a Service (Micro SaaS)\n- Newsletters and paid communities\n- Consulting and coaching\n- Content creation and sponsorships\n\n**Why Solopreneurship:**\n\n- Complete autonomy over decisions and direction\n- Keep 100% of profits\n- Work on your own schedule\n- No management overhead\n- Direct relationship with customers\n- Geographic freedom\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n- All responsibilities fall on you\n- Limited capacity for growth\n- Isolation and lack of team support\n- Requires diverse skill set\n- Income variability, especially early on",
