    "summary": "A narrative framework dividing stories into three parts—setup, confrontation, and resolution—that has been the foundation of Western storytelling for over two millennia.",
    "explanation": "The Three-Act Structure is a model for organizing narratives that traces its roots to Aristotle's Poetics (335 BCE), where he observed that effective stories have a beginning, middle, and end. This seemingly simple observation has evolved into one of the most influential frameworks in storytelling, used across literature, theater, film, and beyond.\n\n**Act 1: Setup (approximately 25% of the story)**\n\nThe first act establishes the ordinary world and introduces the protagonist, supporting characters, and setting. It presents the status quo before disruption occurs. The act culminates with the inciting incident—a catalyst event that disrupts the protagonist's world and sets the main conflict in motion. This is followed by the first turning point, where the protagonist commits to addressing the central problem, transitioning the story into Act 2. Key goals include making the audience care about the characters and understand what's at stake.\n\n**Act 2: Confrontation (approximately 50% of the story)**\n\nThe longest act presents the bulk of the conflict and character development. The protagonist pursues their goal while facing escalating obstacles, complications, and antagonistic forces. A crucial element is the midpoint—a significant event roughly halfway through that raises the stakes or shifts the protagonist's understanding of their situation. The second act builds tension through rising action, often featuring subplot development and character growth through trials. It concludes with the second turning point (sometimes called the 'dark night of the soul'), typically the protagonist's lowest moment, which propels them into the final act.\n\n**Act 3: Resolution (approximately 25% of the story)**\n\nThe final act begins with the protagonist's renewed commitment to their goal, armed with lessons learned. It builds to the climax—the moment of highest tension where the central conflict reaches its peak and is ultimately resolved. Following the climax, the falling action and denouement tie up remaining story threads and show the new equilibrium, demonstrating how the protagonist and their world have been transformed.\n\n**Key Plot Points**\n\nThe structure relies on pivotal moments: the inciting incident launches the story; the first turning point ends Act 1; the midpoint shifts the story's direction; the second turning point ends Act 2; and the climax resolves the central conflict.\n\n**Why It Works**\n\nThe Three-Act Structure resonates because it mirrors fundamental patterns in human cognition and experience. We naturally perceive events in terms of cause and effect, problem and solution, journey and arrival. The structure creates satisfying tension-release cycles, provides clear story progression, and ensures emotional payoff. It gives audiences unconscious guideposts that make narratives feel complete and meaningful.\n\n**Applications Beyond Screenwriting**\n\nWhile Hollywood has codified this structure for film, its principles apply broadly: presentations and speeches benefit from clear setup-conflict-resolution arcs; marketing campaigns use it to create compelling brand narratives; video games structure player experiences around these beats; and even personal anecdotes become more engaging when framed this way. Understanding this framework helps both creators craft compelling narratives and audiences appreciate story architecture.",
