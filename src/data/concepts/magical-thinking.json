    "summary": "The belief that unrelated actions, thoughts, or words can influence outcomes through supernatural or mystical means.",
    "explanation": "Magical thinking is a cognitive pattern in which a person believes that their thoughts, words, actions, or rituals can influence unconnected events through mechanisms that defy established scientific causality. It is a normal part of early childhood development but can persist into adulthood in various forms.\n\n**Common manifestations**:\n\n- **Superstitions**: Believing that a lucky charm, ritual, or avoidance of certain actions (like walking under a ladder) can influence outcomes\n- **Thought-action fusion**: Believing that thinking about something can make it happen (e.g., thinking about an accident causing one)\n- **Correlation as causation**: Wearing a particular shirt during a sports game and believing it helped the team win\n- **Rituals and talismans**: Performing specific routines before important events to ensure success\n\n**Psychological roots**:\n\nMagical thinking often emerges from our need for control and certainty in an uncertain world. When faced with randomness, the human mind seeks patterns and causal connections, even where none exist. This desire for agency can lead to attributing outcomes to personal thoughts or rituals rather than acknowledging chance.\n\n**Relationship to cognitive biases**:\n\n- **Confirmation bias**: We notice when our magical beliefs seem confirmed and ignore disconfirmation\n- **Illusion of control**: Overestimating our ability to influence random events\n- **Post hoc reasoning**: Assuming that because B followed A, A caused B\n\n**When magical thinking becomes problematic**:\n\nWhile mild magical thinking (like wearing lucky socks) is generally harmless, it becomes problematic when it replaces evidence-based decision-making, leads to self-blame for uncontrollable events, or substitutes for meaningful action. In extreme cases, it can be associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and other anxiety disorders.\n\n**Counteracting magical thinking**:\n\n- Developing scientific literacy and critical thinking skills\n- Understanding probability and randomness\n- Practicing metacognition to recognize magical thought patterns\n- Distinguishing between correlation and causation",
