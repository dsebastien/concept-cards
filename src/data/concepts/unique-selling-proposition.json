    "summary": "The distinct feature or benefit that sets a product apart from competitors.",
    "explanation": "A Unique Selling Proposition is what makes your offering different and better than alternatives in the market. Coined by advertising executive Rosser Reeves in the 1940s, a USP must meet three criteria: it must be a specific proposition ('Buy this product, get this benefit'), it must be unique (competitors can't or don't offer it), and it must be strong enough to move customers. Your USP isn't just any difference—it must matter to customers. For creators and knowledge workers, your USP might be your specific methodology, unique experience combination, or distinctive voice. Without a clear USP, you compete on price, which is rarely sustainable.",
