    "summary": "A powerful note-taking app that uses local Markdown files and linking.",
    "explanation": "Obsidian is a powerful tool for thought that uses local Markdown files, emphasizes linking between notes, and includes a graph view to visualize connections. Benefits include: local-first (you own your data), Markdown-based (future-proof and portable), extensive plugin ecosystem, graph visualization, Canvas for visual thinking, and strong community. Obsidian serves as a thinking headquarters - a fourth place beyond home, work, and social spaces where thoughts can exist, be developed, and grow. It's all you need from simple notes to complete productivity.",
