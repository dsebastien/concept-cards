    "summary": "Becoming the recognized expert in a specific, focused area rather than a generalist in a broad field.",
    "explanation": "Niche Authority is the strategy of becoming the go-to expert in a tightly defined area. Rather than competing as a generalist in broad markets, you dominate a small pond and expand from there.\n\n**Why Niche Works:**\n- **Less competition** - Fewer people own narrow niches\n- **Clearer positioning** - Easier to be known for one thing\n- **Higher perceived expertise** - Specialists command more trust\n- **Better content-market fit** - Easier to serve specific needs\n- **Word of mouth** - 'Talk to X about Y' referrals\n- **Premium pricing** - Specialists charge more than generalists\n\n**The Niche Paradox:**\nGoing narrow feels limiting but actually expands opportunity. When you're known for something specific, opportunities find you. Generalists compete; specialists get sought out.\n\n**Finding Your Niche:**\n1. **Intersection method** - Combine 2-3 skills/interests uniquely\n2. **Audience method** - Who can you help that others can't?\n3. **Problem method** - What specific problem do you solve?\n4. **Experience method** - What have you done that few others have?\n\n**Niche Examples:**\n- Not 'marketing' but 'email marketing for SaaS startups'\n- Not 'productivity' but 'PKM for academic researchers'\n- Not 'fitness' but 'strength training for busy parents'\n\n**The Expansion Path:**\n```\nNarrow niche → Authority → Adjacent niches → Broader platform\n```\n\nStart narrow, establish authority, then expand. It's easier to go from specialist to generalist than the reverse.\n\n**Caution:**\nNiche too small and there's no market. Niche too broad and you're invisible. The sweet spot is narrow enough to own, large enough to sustain.",
