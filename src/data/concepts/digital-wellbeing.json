    "name": "Digital Wellbeing",
    "summary": "The state of personal health and wellness in relation to technology use, encompassing strategies and practices to use digital devices in balanced, healthy ways.",
    "explanation": "Digital wellbeing refers to the physical, psychological, and social effects of digital devices and services on individuals, along with practices to maintain healthy technology habits. As smartphones and social media became ubiquitous, concerns grew about their negative impacts: addiction, distraction, sleep disruption, anxiety, depression, and harmful social comparison. The term gained prominence in the late 2010s when tech companies like Google and Apple launched 'Digital Wellbeing' features—screen time tracking, app timers, and notification controls—partly in response to criticism of the attention economy.\n\nThe field draws on psychology, neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. Key figures include Cal Newport (Digital Minimalism), Tristan Harris and the Center for Humane Technology, and Nir Eyal (Indistractable). Approaches range from individual strategies like phone-free bedrooms and app deletion to systemic changes including regulation and alternative business models. Critics argue that platform-provided 'digital wellbeing' features can be superficial—tools offered by companies that profit from attention to limit that same attention—while the underlying engagement-maximizing business model remains unchanged. True digital wellbeing may require fundamentally rethinking how technology is designed and monetized, not just adding optional limits.\n\nCommon concerns include phone addiction (compulsive checking, phantom vibrations), sleep disruption from blue light and stimulation, attention fragmentation from constant context switching, FOMO driving compulsive checking, and loneliness despite social media connectivity. Individual strategies include notification audits, grayscale mode, app timers, morning phone-free routines, and periodic social media breaks. Platform features like iOS Screen Time, Android Digital Wellbeing, and YouTube's Take a Break reminders provide usage dashboards and limits. Systemic solutions encompass children's protection regulation, subscription-based alternatives to attention-driven business models, humane design principles, digital literacy education, and workplace right-to-disconnect policies.",
