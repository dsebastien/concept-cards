    "summary": "Forming beliefs and making decisions based on what is pleasing to imagine rather than on evidence or rationality.",
    "explanation": "Wishful thinking is a cognitive bias in which a person forms beliefs, makes decisions, or interprets information based on what they wish were true rather than on evidence, logic, or reality. It represents a fundamental distortion in reasoning where desires override objective assessment.\n\n**How wishful thinking manifests**:\n\n- **Planning**: Underestimating project timelines because we want things to be easier than they are (related to the planning fallacy)\n- **Investing**: Holding onto losing investments because we believe they will recover\n- **Relationships**: Ignoring red flags because we want a relationship to work\n- **Health**: Dismissing symptoms because we don't want to be sick\n- **Business**: Overestimating market demand because we're excited about our product\n\n**Psychological mechanisms**:\n\n- **Motivation-driven reasoning**: Our desires unconsciously bias our information processing\n- **Selective attention**: We focus on information that supports desired outcomes\n- **Desirability bias**: We judge desirable outcomes as more probable than undesirable ones\n- **Emotional reasoning**: Feeling that something is true because we want it to be\n\n**Wishful thinking vs. optimism**:\n\nHealthy optimism acknowledges challenges while maintaining hope and motivation. Wishful thinking, by contrast, ignores or minimizes challenges entirely. The key difference is whether one is prepared to take realistic action or simply hoping for the best.\n\n**Counteracting wishful thinking**:\n\n- Practice pre-mortem analysis: imagine the plan has failed and identify reasons why\n- Seek disconfirming evidence actively\n- Ask: 'Would I believe this if I didn't want it to be true?'\n- Use structured decision-making frameworks\n- Consult diverse perspectives, especially from skeptics",
