    "name": "Durability",
    "summary": "The property ensuring that data persists and survives system failures, power outages, and crashes.",
    "explanation": "Durability is a fundamental property of data storage systems that guarantees once data is successfully written or a transaction is committed, it will persist even in the face of system failures, power outages, crashes, or other disruptions. It's the 'D' in the ACID properties of database systems and a critical concern for anyone managing important information.\n\n**Why durability matters**:\n\n- **Data permanence**: Ensures your work isn't lost due to technical failures\n- **Trust in systems**: Users can rely on saved data actually being saved\n- **Business continuity**: Organizations depend on data surviving unexpected events\n- **Knowledge preservation**: For PKM, durability ensures years of accumulated notes survive\n\n**How durability is achieved**:\n\n- **Write-ahead logging (WAL)**: Changes are logged before being applied, enabling recovery\n- **Journaling file systems**: Track changes to recover from crashes (ext4, NTFS, APFS)\n- **Synchronous writes**: Force data to physical storage before confirming success\n- **Replication**: Copy data to multiple locations to survive hardware failures\n- **Checksums**: Detect and correct data corruption over time\n\n**Durability in personal knowledge management**:\n\n- Store notes in plain text formats that don't depend on specific software\n- Use file systems and storage that implement journaling\n- Follow the 3-2-1 backup rule to ensure copies survive disasters\n- Consider version control (Git) for additional durability and history\n- Test backups regularly - untested backups aren't truly durable\n\n**Durability vs. availability**: Durability ensures data isn't lost; availability ensures data is accessible. A system can be durable (data is safe on disk) but unavailable (the server is down). Both are essential but address different concerns.\n\n**Trade-offs**: Stronger durability guarantees often come at the cost of performance. Synchronous writes are slower than asynchronous ones. The appropriate balance depends on how critical the data is - financial transactions need strong durability, while temporary cache data may not.",
