    "summary": "Encouraging customers to purchase a higher-end or upgraded version of what they're buying.",
    "explanation": "Upselling increases transaction value by offering customers premium alternatives. Examples include larger sizes, better features, extended warranties, or premium tiers. Effective upselling focuses on genuine value—how the upgrade better serves the customer's needs—rather than just maximizing revenue. The best time to upsell is when customers have already committed to buying, as they're in a purchasing mindset. Success requires understanding what additional value matters to each customer. For creators, upselling might mean offering a premium course tier with coaching, a bundle instead of a single product, or a longer membership term at a discount. The key is making the upgrade feel like a smart choice, not a pressure tactic.",
