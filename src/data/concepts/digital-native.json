    "summary": "A person who has grown up with digital technology from childhood, intuitively understanding and navigating computers, the internet, and mobile devices.",
    "explanation": "## What is a Digital Native?\n\nA digital native is a person who was born during or after the widespread adoption of digital technology and has been exposed to computers, the internet, and mobile devices from an early age. The term was coined by education consultant Marc Prensky in his 2001 article \"Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants,\" published in On the Horizon. Prensky argued that growing up immersed in technology fundamentally changes how people think, learn, and process information.\n\n## Characteristics\n\nDigital natives are generally characterized by their comfort and fluency with technology. They tend to prefer receiving information quickly, are accustomed to multitasking and parallel processing, favor graphics over text, function best when networked, and prefer instant gratification and frequent rewards. For them, technology is not a tool they had to learn but rather an integrated part of their environment from birth.\n\n## Criticism and Nuance\n\nThe digital native concept has faced significant criticism from researchers. Studies have shown that simply growing up around technology does not automatically confer deep understanding of how it works. Many young people are proficient consumers of technology but lack critical digital literacy skills such as evaluating online sources, understanding privacy implications, or creating digital content. The binary distinction between digital natives and digital immigrants has been called an oversimplification that ignores socioeconomic factors, access disparities, individual differences, and the continuous nature of technological adaptation.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nDespite its limitations, the digital native concept has profoundly influenced education, workplace design, marketing, and technology development. It highlights the real generational differences in technology expectations and usage patterns. Understanding these differences helps educators design more effective learning experiences, helps organizations build better digital tools, and helps individuals recognize their own technological assumptions and blind spots. The concept also sparked important conversations about how technology shapes cognition, culture, and identity across generations.",
