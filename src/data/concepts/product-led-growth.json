    "summary": "A go-to-market strategy where the product itself drives customer acquisition, conversion, and expansion.",
    "explanation": "Product-Led Growth flips traditional sales-driven models by using the product as the primary vehicle for acquiring, converting, and retaining customers. Instead of requiring sales conversations before trying a product, PLG companies offer free trials or freemium tiers that let users experience value immediately. The product itself handles onboarding, demonstrates value, and encourages upgrades. Companies like Slack, Dropbox, and Notion exemplify this approach. PLG requires excellent user experience, clear time-to-value, and natural viral or network effects. For creators, PLG thinking means creating free content or tools that demonstrate expertise and naturally lead to paid offerings—let your work sell itself.",
