    "summary": "The practice of systematically recording personal data about daily activities, habits, health, and life events over time.",
    "explanation": "Life tracking is the deliberate practice of recording information about your daily life to gain insights, identify patterns, and support personal growth. Unlike the broader Quantified Self movement which emphasizes technology and metrics, life tracking can be as simple as journaling or as sophisticated as automated sensor data. Common tracking domains include: time (how you spend your hours), habits (completion of routines), health (sleep, exercise, nutrition, symptoms), mood and energy levels, productivity and focus, finances, relationships and social interactions, and significant life events. Methods range from manual logging (journals, spreadsheets, bullet journals) to semi-automated apps to fully automated wearables and smart devices. The practice leverages the mere measurement effect—simply tracking something tends to improve it. Benefits include: accountability (what gets measured gets managed), pattern recognition (correlating behaviors with outcomes), memory augmentation (creating a searchable life record), and decision support (evidence-based life choices). Effective life tracking requires: choosing meaningful metrics aligned with goals, sustainable tracking habits, regular review sessions, and acting on insights. Common pitfalls include tracking too much, becoming obsessive, and collecting data without analysis. For knowledge workers, tracking work patterns, energy cycles, and habit completion provides valuable feedback for optimizing performance and wellbeing.",
