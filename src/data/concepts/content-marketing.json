    "explanation": "Content marketing builds relationships by providing consistent, relevant, and valuable content to your audience—without directly selling. Instead of pitching products, you deliver information that makes customers smarter or helps solve their problems. The approach works because trust precedes transactions. Content formats include blog posts, newsletters, podcasts, videos, infographics, and social media. The strategy requires understanding your audience's questions, creating content that answers them, and distributing through channels where they already spend time. For knowledge workers and creators, content marketing is often the primary growth engine—your expertise becomes marketing. The challenge is consistency and patience; content marketing compounds over time.",
