    "summary": "The practice of planning, creating, and managing content to achieve specific business or communication goals.",
    "explanation": "Content strategy is the planning and governance of content creation, delivery, and maintenance across channels. It begins with audience research to understand who the content serves, what questions they have, and how they consume information. A content audit of existing materials helps identify gaps and opportunities. Editorial calendars provide structure and consistency, while content pillars define the core themes that align with organizational goals.\n\nSEO considerations ensure content is discoverable, but effective content strategy goes beyond keyword optimization to focus on genuine value creation. Repurposing strategies maximize the impact of each piece of content by adapting it for different formats and platforms. Content lifecycle management addresses creation, publication, maintenance, and eventual archival or retirement of content.\n\nMeasuring content effectiveness through analytics, engagement metrics, and conversion tracking closes the feedback loop and informs future planning. Content strategy differs from content marketing in scope: while content marketing focuses on using content to attract and retain customers, content strategy encompasses the broader governance framework that ensures all content serves its intended purpose effectively.",
