    "summary": "The tendency to increase spending as income rises, preventing wealth accumulation and financial freedom.",
    "explanation": "Lifestyle inflation (also called lifestyle creep) is the pattern of increasing spending as income grows. When people receive a raise, bonus, or promotion, they tend to upgrade their lifestyle — a bigger apartment, a nicer car, more dining out, premium subscriptions — so that expenses rise to match or even exceed the new income level. The result is that despite earning more, they feel no wealthier and remain just as dependent on their paycheck.\n\n**How lifestyle inflation works**:\n\n- A pay increase creates a gap between income and expenses\n- Social comparison and hedonic adaptation drive spending upward to fill that gap\n- Each upgrade becomes the new baseline, thanks to hedonic adaptation\n- The cycle repeats with each income increase, maintaining or worsening the time-money tradeoff\n\n**Why it's dangerous**:\n\n- It eliminates the path to financial independence — higher earnings should accelerate savings, but lifestyle inflation prevents this\n- It creates golden handcuffs — the high lifestyle requires the high income, making it risky to change careers, start a business, or take time off\n- It increases vulnerability — higher fixed costs mean less resilience to income disruptions\n- It shifts the hedonic treadmill upward without increasing lasting happiness\n\n**Counterstrategies**:\n\n- **Pay yourself first**: Automatically save or invest a fixed percentage of any income increase before it reaches your spending account\n- **Conscious spending**: Distinguish between spending that genuinely improves well-being and spending driven by social comparison or habit\n- **Lifestyle cap**: Set a deliberate ceiling on living expenses regardless of income growth\n- **Time audit**: Before upgrading, ask whether the purchase adds time freedom or subtracts it through maintenance, complexity, and the need for continued high income\n- **Gap awareness**: Track the gap between income and expenses as the key metric, not income alone\n\nThe antidote to lifestyle inflation is not deprivation but intentionality — spending more on what truly matters while refusing to let expenses rise automatically with income.",
