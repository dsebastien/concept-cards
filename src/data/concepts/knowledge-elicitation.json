    "explanation": "## What Is Knowledge Elicitation?\n\nKnowledge elicitation is the set of methods and techniques used to extract knowledge -- especially tacit, experiential knowledge -- from domain experts and make it available in explicit form. It addresses the fundamental challenge that experts often cannot spontaneously articulate what they know; their expertise has become so deeply internalized that it operates below conscious awareness.\n\n## Why Knowledge Elicitation Is Difficult\n\nSeveral factors make extracting expert knowledge challenging:\n\n- **Tacit nature**: experts perform complex tasks \"automatically\" and struggle to explain their reasoning\n- **Curse of knowledge**: experts forget what it's like to not know, making them poor at identifying what needs to be explained\n- **Compilation effect**: with experience, complex chains of reasoning become compressed into seemingly instant judgments\n- **Context dependence**: expert knowledge is often deeply tied to specific situations and hard to generalize\n\n## Common Techniques\n\n### Interview-Based Methods\n- **Structured interviews**: predefined questions that systematically cover a domain\n- **Critical incident technique**: asking experts to describe specific past situations where their expertise was critical\n- **Think-aloud protocols**: experts narrate their reasoning while performing tasks\n\n### Observation-Based Methods\n- **Process tracing**: watching experts work and documenting their decisions and actions\n- **Apprenticeship/shadowing**: learning through prolonged observation and guided practice\n- **Video recording**: capturing expert performance for later analysis\n\n### Structured Methods\n- **Concept mapping**: collaboratively building visual maps of knowledge structures\n- **Card sorting**: having experts organize domain concepts into meaningful categories\n- **Repertory grid technique**: systematically uncovering how experts distinguish between cases\n\n## Applications\n\nKnowledge elicitation is used in: building expert systems and AI, creating training programs, documenting organizational processes, writing runbooks and standard operating procedures, succession planning, and building knowledge bases.\n\n## In PKM\n\nPersonal knowledge elicitation involves self-reflection techniques to surface your own tacit knowledge: journaling about decision processes, explaining your work to others (rubber duck debugging, Feynman technique), and systematically documenting the \"why\" behind your choices.",
