    "explanation": "LangChain is an open-source orchestration framework for building applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). Available in both Python and JavaScript, it provides tools and APIs to simplify building LLM-driven applications like chatbots, AI agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.\n\nThe framework serves as a generic interface for nearly any LLM, providing a centralized development environment to build applications and integrate them with external data sources and software workflows.\n\nKey features include:\n- **Modular architecture**: Chain together interoperable components\n- **Model agnostic**: Connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other providers\n- **Tool integration**: Built-in support for external tools and APIs\n- **Memory systems**: Short-term and long-term conversation memory\n- **Retrieval mechanisms**: Document loaders, text splitters, and vector stores\n- **Prompt templates**: Reusable, parameterized prompts\n\nLangChain's ecosystem includes several libraries: LangChain-core (fundamental abstractions), integration packages (provider-specific integrations), chains (sequential processing pipelines), agents (autonomous decision-making components), and retrievers (document retrieval mechanisms).\n\nLangChain applications typically follow common patterns: chains for linear sequences of operations, agents for dynamic decision-making with tool selection, and RAG pipelines for retrieving context, augmenting prompts, and generating responses.\n\nLimitations include a steep learning curve due to layered abstractions, overhead that may be excessive for simple applications, and rapid API changes between versions.",
