    "summary": "The principle that all scientific knowledge is provisional, approximate, and subject to revision, and that no scientific theory should be treated as final, complete, or absolutely true.",
    "explanation": "Scientific fallibilism is the epistemological position that all scientific knowledge is inherently provisional, incomplete, and open to revision. No scientific theory, no matter how well-supported, should be considered the final, permanent truth. Science progresses not by establishing certainties, but by producing models that are progressively 'less wrong.'\n\nThis principle is built into the scientific method itself:\n\n- Scientists learn about existing findings\n- They question those findings\n- They attempt to produce better models that supersede the old ones\n- The new models will themselves eventually be questioned and improved\n\nA classic illustration: Newton's laws of motion worked perfectly for centuries. Then Einstein's relativity showed their limits at extreme speeds and masses. Then quantum mechanics revealed limits in Einstein's framework. Yet Newton's laws are still used to launch satellites — because they're useful, even though they're not 'true' in an absolute sense.\n\nKey implications of scientific fallibilism:\n\n- **Usefulness over truth**: The most accurate theory is not always the most useful one. A 'less true' but simpler model may be more practical for everyday purposes.\n- **Progressive refinement**: Science doesn't establish truths; it builds progressively better approximations.\n- **Humility about certainty**: If even the most rigorous form of human inquiry (science) produces provisional knowledge, how much more provisional must our personal beliefs, opinions, and intuitions be?\n\nScientific fallibilism is a cornerstone of the 'Useful Not True' philosophy: if even science — our best system for understanding reality — produces tools rather than truths, then treating personal beliefs as absolute truths is unjustified.",
