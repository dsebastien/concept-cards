    "summary": "The brain region essential for forming new memories and spatial navigation.",
    "explanation": "The hippocampus is a seahorse-shaped structure in the brain's temporal lobe that plays a critical role in converting short-term memories into long-term memories (memory consolidation) and spatial navigation. It acts as a memory indexer, organizing and connecting memories with their context, time, and location. The hippocampus is one of the few brain regions where neurogenesis (new neuron formation) continues in adulthood. Chronic stress and elevated cortisol can damage the hippocampus, impairing memory formation. Conversely, exercise, learning, and quality sleep promote hippocampal health and neurogenesis. Understanding the hippocampus explains why sleep is crucial for learning, why stress impairs memory, and why techniques like spaced repetition work for long-term retention.",
