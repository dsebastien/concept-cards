    "summary": "The degree to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.",
    "explanation": "Usability is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use. It's defined by five quality components identified by Jakob Nielsen:\n\n**The Five Components of Usability**:\n\n1. **Learnability**: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?\n\n2. **Efficiency**: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?\n\n3. **Memorability**: When users return after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?\n\n4. **Errors**: How many errors do users make, how severe are they, and how easily can users recover?\n\n5. **Satisfaction**: How pleasant is it to use the design?\n\n**Usability vs. Utility**:\n\n- **Utility**: Does it provide the features you need?\n- **Usability**: How easy and pleasant are those features to use?\n- **Usefulness**: Utility + Usability combined\n\nA product can have high utility (many features) but low usability (hard to use), or vice versa.\n\n**Measuring Usability**:\n\n- **Task Success Rate**: Percentage of correctly completed tasks\n- **Time on Task**: How long tasks take to complete\n- **Error Rate**: Number and severity of errors\n- **System Usability Scale (SUS)**: Standardized questionnaire\n- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: Likelihood to recommend\n\n**Usability Testing Methods**:\n\n- **Moderated Testing**: Researcher guides participants through tasks\n- **Unmoderated Testing**: Users complete tasks independently (remote)\n- **A/B Testing**: Compare two versions with different users\n- **Heuristic Evaluation**: Experts evaluate against principles\n- **Cognitive Walkthrough**: Step through tasks from user perspective\n\n**Why Usability Matters**:\n\n- Users leave sites that are hard to use\n- Poor usability increases support costs\n- Good usability reduces training time\n- Usability affects brand perception\n- Accessibility and usability overlap significantly\n\nUsability should be considered throughout the design process, not just at the end. Testing early with rough prototypes catches problems when they're cheap to fix.",
