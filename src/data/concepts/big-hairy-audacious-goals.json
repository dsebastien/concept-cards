    "explanation": "Big Hairy Audacious Goals (BHAGs) are ambitious and inspiring targets that represent the big achievements you're aiming for. Having these large goals helps create a vision, brings clarity, and sheds light on the path ahead. However, BHAGs can be overwhelming and lead to procrastination if not handled properly. The key is to decompose them into atomic tasks while keeping the big goal in mind. This approach allows you to notice regular progress, creating a positive feedback loop that sustains motivation. BHAGs work well with reverse goal setting and help you avoid underestimating what you can achieve over longer time horizons.",
