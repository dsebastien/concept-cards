    "name": "First Impressions",
    "summary": "The rapid, often lasting judgments we form about people, products, and experiences within the first moments of encounter.",
    "explanation": "First Impressions are the rapid judgments we form about people, products, or situations within seconds of initial contact. Research shows these judgments are formed in as little as 100 milliseconds and, once formed, are remarkably resistant to change—a phenomenon related to belief perseverance and anchoring.\n\n**Why First Impressions Are So Powerful:**\n\n1. **Primacy effect**: Information received first has disproportionate influence on overall judgment\n2. **Confirmation bias**: After forming an impression, we selectively notice evidence that confirms it\n3. **Halo effect**: A positive first impression colors our perception of all subsequent attributes\n4. **Cognitive efficiency**: The brain uses shortcuts to conserve energy; revising impressions takes effort\n\n**The Thin-Slicing Phenomenon:**\n\nMalcolm Gladwell's 'Blink' popularized the concept of thin-slicing—making accurate judgments from minimal information. While sometimes useful, thin-slicing can also lead to bias and error, especially when snap judgments are based on superficial cues.\n\n**Applications:**\n\n- **Personal branding**: How you present yourself in first meetings shapes long-term relationships\n- **Product launches**: Users decide within seconds whether to explore further\n- **Content creation**: Opening lines determine whether anyone reads the rest\n- **User experience**: App and website first experiences determine retention\n- **Job interviews**: Initial impression often predicts hiring decision regardless of subsequent information\n\n**Working With First Impressions:**\n\n**Creating good first impressions:**\n- Prioritize the first interaction above all others\n- Ensure your best qualities are visible immediately\n- Remove friction from initial experiences\n\n**Overcoming first impressions:**\n- Recognize they're often based on incomplete information\n- Actively seek disconfirming evidence\n- Give people and products second chances after time passes\n- Practice intellectual humility about snap judgments\n\n**The Double-Edged Sword:**\n\nFirst impressions serve an evolutionary purpose—rapid threat assessment kept our ancestors alive. But in modern contexts, they can lead to unfair judgments, missed opportunities, and difficulty recovering from initial missteps.",
