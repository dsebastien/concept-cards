    "explanation": "Mindfulness is the practice of present-moment awareness - paying attention to thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and environment without judgment. Mindfulness improves focus, reduces stress, enhances decision-making, and supports emotional regulation. For PKM, mindfulness helps with intentional consumption (rather than mindless scrolling), recognizing what truly resonates, and being present while learning. Mindful note-taking involves fully engaging with content rather than passive capture.",
