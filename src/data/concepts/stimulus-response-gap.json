    "summary": "The crucial moment between an external event and one's reaction to it, where the power of conscious choice exists, allowing a deliberate response rather than an automatic reaction.",
    "explanation": "The stimulus-response gap is the space between something happening to you (a stimulus) and how you react to it (your response). In this gap lies the freedom to choose your reaction rather than being controlled by automatic impulses, conditioned habits, or emotional reflexes.\n\nThis concept is often attributed to Viktor Frankl, who wrote about finding freedom even in the most extreme circumstances. The core insight is that while you cannot control what happens to you, you always retain the power to choose how you interpret and respond to it.\n\nThe process works in five steps:\n\n1. **Something happens** — an event, a comment, a setback\n2. **Your first reaction fires** — an automatic emotional response (anger, fear, defensiveness)\n3. **You notice the gap** — the brief moment before you act on that reaction\n4. **You consider alternatives** — other ways to interpret or respond to the situation\n5. **You choose deliberately** — selecting the response that best serves your goals and values\n\nThe gap can be expanded through practices like mindfulness meditation, journaling, and deliberate reflection. With practice, the automatic first reaction becomes less controlling, and the space for choice grows wider.\n\nThis concept is foundational to emotional intelligence, cognitive behavioral therapy, and Stoic philosophy. It is the mechanism through which all reframing becomes possible — without the gap, there is no room to choose a different perspective.",
