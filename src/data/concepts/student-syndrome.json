    "name": "Student Syndrome",
    "summary": "The tendency to delay starting work until the last possible moment before a deadline, even when given extra buffer time.",
    "explanation": "Student Syndrome describes the human tendency to procrastinate and only begin working on a task at the last possible moment, even when ample time or buffer has been provided. The term was popularized by Eliyahu Goldratt in his work on Critical Chain Project Management.\n\n## How it manifests\n\nWhen a task is estimated at 5 days but given a 10-day buffer for safety, a person with Student Syndrome won't start until day 5 or later. The buffer that was meant to absorb unexpected problems instead gets consumed by delayed starts. If anything goes wrong in the remaining time, the task still runs late - making the safety buffer entirely pointless.\n\n## Why it matters for planning\n\nStudent Syndrome is a key reason why adding buffer time to project estimates often fails to prevent delays. It creates a one-way ratchet: if a task finishes early, the saved time is rarely passed on to the next task. But if a task runs late, the delay cascades through the project. This means individual task buffers tend to be wasted rather than providing genuine protection.\n\n## Root causes\n\n- **Parkinson's Law**: work expands to fill the time available\n- **Present bias**: future deadlines feel less urgent than immediate distractions\n- **Optimism about future self**: we believe our future self will be more disciplined\n- **Multiple commitments**: people juggle many tasks and prioritize the most urgent\n\n## Countermeasures\n\n- **Critical Chain**: remove individual task buffers and pool them into project-level buffers that management controls\n- **Intermediate milestones**: create earlier checkpoints that force work to start sooner\n- **Work-in-progress limits**: reduce multitasking so people focus on fewer tasks\n- **Daily standups**: create social accountability for progress\n- **Time tracking**: make delay patterns visible",
