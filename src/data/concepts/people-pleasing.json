    "summary": "The habitual pattern of prioritizing others' approval and comfort over one's own needs, values, and authentic self-expression.",
    "explanation": "## What Is People-Pleasing?\n\nPeople-pleasing is a behavioral pattern characterized by the chronic prioritization of others' needs, preferences, and approval over one's own. People-pleasers say yes when they mean no, avoid expressing disagreement, suppress genuine opinions, and shape their behavior to match what they believe others want from them. While often mistaken for kindness or agreeableness, people-pleasing is fundamentally driven by fear -- of rejection, conflict, abandonment, or disapproval.\n\n## Root Causes\n\nPeople-pleasing typically develops from:\n\n- **Childhood conditioning**: growing up in environments where love or safety was conditional on compliance\n- **Attachment patterns**: insecure attachment styles that equate acceptance with self-worth\n- **Conflict avoidance**: learned associations between honest expression and negative consequences\n- **Low self-worth**: believing that your genuine self is insufficient and must be supplemented by service to others\n- **Cultural messaging**: socialization that frames self-sacrifice as virtue, particularly for certain genders\n\n## The Costs\n\n### Personal\n- Chronic resentment from unmet needs\n- Identity erosion: losing touch with genuine preferences and values\n- Burnout from constant emotional labor\n- Anxiety about maintaining approval\n- Suppressed creativity and authentic expression\n\n### Relational\n- Relationships built on a false version of yourself\n- Others cannot truly know or trust someone who hides their real reactions\n- Enabling dysfunction by not setting boundaries\n- The eventual explosion of suppressed resentment\n\n### Professional\n- Overcommitment and inability to prioritize\n- Difficulty giving honest feedback or disagreeing\n- Career choices driven by others' expectations\n- Reduced innovation from suppressed ideas\n\n## People-Pleasing vs. Genuine Kindness\n\n| People-Pleasing | Genuine Kindness |\n|---|---|\n| Motivated by fear of rejection | Motivated by care for others |\n| Depletes energy and builds resentment | Energizing and freely given |\n| Says yes regardless of capacity | Says yes when genuinely willing |\n| Loses self in service to others | Maintains self while serving others |\n| Cannot tolerate others' discomfort | Accepts that not everyone will be happy |\n\n## Recovery\n\n- **Develop self-awareness**: notice when you're performing vs. expressing\n- **Practice small refusals**: build the muscle of saying no in low-stakes situations\n- **Tolerate discomfort**: others' temporary disappointment is not catastrophic\n- **Clarify values**: know what you stand for so you have a compass beyond approval\n- **Set boundaries**: boundaries are not selfish -- they enable sustainable generosity\n- **Embrace radical authenticity**: gradually replace performance with genuine expression",
