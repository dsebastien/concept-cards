    "summary": "Building value through sustained, consistent effort over time rather than seeking quick wins or viral growth.",
    "explanation": "A slow burn is the deliberate strategy of building something valuable through sustained, consistent effort rather than chasing quick wins or viral moments. The term originates from cooking and fire-tending, where controlled, steady heat produces better results than intense flames.\n\nIn creative work, content creation, business building, and personal development, the slow burn approach prioritizes:\n\n**Consistency over intensity**: Rather than sporadic bursts of effort, slow burn emphasizes showing up regularly with sustainable output. Writing one article weekly for years beats publishing frantically for a month then burning out.\n\n**Depth over breadth**: Instead of chasing every opportunity, slow burn focuses on building genuine expertise and relationships in a focused domain.\n\n**Compounding over immediacy**: Each piece of work, each connection, each skill builds on previous efforts. The results may be invisible for months or years before becoming undeniable.\n\n**Sustainability over hustle**: Slow burn rejects the hustle culture mentality that leads to burnout. It accepts that meaningful achievements require time and energy management.\n\n**Why slow burn works:**\n\n1. **Trust accumulates**: Audiences, clients, and collaborators develop trust through repeated positive interactions over time.\n\n2. **Skills compound**: Deliberate practice over extended periods produces mastery that shortcuts cannot replicate.\n\n3. **Luck surface area expands**: Consistent presence increases opportunities for serendipitous connections and discoveries.\n\n4. **Quality improves**: Without pressure for immediate results, you can focus on craft and iteration.\n\n5. **Resilience builds**: Slow burn practitioners develop patience and persistence that help weather inevitable setbacks.\n\nThe slow burn approach is particularly relevant for knowledge workers, creators, entrepreneurs, and anyone building expertise or reputation. While it may feel frustrating compared to viral success stories, slow burn success tends to be more durable and satisfying.\n\nThe paradox of slow burn is that by not optimizing for speed, you often achieve more in the long run.",
