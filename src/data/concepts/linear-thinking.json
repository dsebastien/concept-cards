    "explanation": "Linear Thinking is sequential, logical reasoning that moves step-by-step from premise to conclusion. While valuable for structured problem-solving and analysis, linear thinking can miss non-linear relationships, feedback loops, and emergent properties. Real-world systems are often non-linear. Complementing linear thinking with systems thinking, lateral thinking, and radiant thinking helps capture complexity that sequential analysis might miss. The best thinkers move fluidly between linear and non-linear modes.",
