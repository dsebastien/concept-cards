    "name": "Sensory Overload",
    "summary": "Overwhelming state when one or more senses receive more stimulation than the brain can process.",
    "explanation": "Sensory Overload occurs when one or more of the body's senses experiences over-stimulation from the environment. When sensory input exceeds the brain's processing capacity, it can trigger feelings of overwhelm, anxiety, irritability, and an urgent need to escape the situation.\n\n**Common triggers**:\n- **Visual**: Bright or flashing lights, cluttered spaces, rapid visual movement, screens\n- **Auditory**: Loud noises, multiple conversations, background music, traffic, notifications\n- **Tactile**: Crowds, uncomfortable clothing textures, temperature extremes\n- **Olfactory**: Strong perfumes, food smells, cleaning products\n- **Combined**: Busy environments like shopping malls, concerts, open offices\n\n**Who experiences it**: While anyone can experience sensory overload under extreme conditions, it particularly affects people with autism spectrum conditions, ADHD, anxiety disorders, PTSD, migraines, and those who are highly sensitive (HSPs). Knowledge workers in open offices or high-stimulus environments are also susceptible.\n\n**Symptoms**:\n- Difficulty focusing or thinking clearly\n- Irritability or emotional dysregulation\n- Physical discomfort or restlessness\n- Feeling overwhelmed or anxious\n- Need to escape or shut down\n- Physical symptoms (headache, fatigue)\n\n**Management strategies**:\n- Identify and limit exposure to known triggers\n- Create low-stimulus environments (noise-canceling headphones, decluttered workspace)\n- Take regular sensory breaks in quiet spaces\n- Practice grounding techniques\n- Communicate needs to colleagues and family\n- Design workspaces with sensory regulation in mind\n\nUnderstanding sensory overload helps create more inclusive environments and enables individuals to protect their cognitive capacity for meaningful work.",
