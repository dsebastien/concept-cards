    "summary": "James Pennebaker's therapeutic writing method involving sustained writing about deeply personal emotional experiences to improve health and well-being.",
    "explanation": "Expressive writing is a therapeutic writing technique developed by psychologist James Pennebaker in the 1980s. The core protocol involves writing about your deepest thoughts and feelings regarding a significant emotional experience for 15 to 20 minutes per day over three to four consecutive days. Unlike other journaling practices, expressive writing specifically targets emotional processing by encouraging writers to explore their most challenging experiences openly and honestly.\n\nThe research supporting expressive writing is extensive and compelling. Studies have demonstrated a wide range of health benefits, including improved immune function (increased T-helper cell activity), fewer doctor visits, lower blood pressure, reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety, and improved working memory. These effects have been replicated across diverse populations and cultures.\n\nThe mechanism behind these benefits appears to involve the cognitive and emotional processing that occurs when translating chaotic emotional experiences into coherent narratives. Writing helps organize fragmented thoughts and memories, making them easier to integrate and ultimately move beyond. The process of labeling emotions through language also appears to reduce their intensity, a phenomenon supported by neuroscience research on affect labeling.\n\nPractical guidelines for expressive writing include: write continuously without worrying about grammar or spelling, explore your deepest emotions honestly, write only for yourself (these entries are not meant to be shared), expect some short-term emotional discomfort that typically resolves within hours, and choose topics that feel genuinely significant to you. The practice is not recommended during acute crisis, when professional support may be more appropriate.",
