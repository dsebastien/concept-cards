    "summary": "AI systems that can take actions, use tools, and pursue goals autonomously.",
    "explanation": "AI agents are systems that go beyond generating text to actually taking actions - using tools, browsing the web, executing code, interacting with APIs, and pursuing multi-step goals with some autonomy. They combine language model reasoning with the ability to act in the world. How they work: the language model reasons about what to do, decides which tools to use, executes actions, observes results, and iterates toward the goal. This loop enables complex, multi-step tasks. Capabilities include: web browsing and research, code execution, file manipulation, API interactions, and orchestrating multi-step workflows. Agent patterns: ReAct (Reasoning + Acting), tool use, planning and execution, and multi-agent systems (agents collaborating). Benefits: can handle complex tasks that require multiple steps, adapt to new situations, and reduce human involvement in routine work. Challenges: reliability (errors compound), safety (actions have consequences), alignment (pursuing correct goals), and cost (many API calls). For knowledge workers, AI agents offer: automation of complex research and analysis, assistance with multi-step workflows, and potential for significant productivity gains - with appropriate oversight for their autonomous actions.",
