    "summary": "A strategic planning method that creates multiple plausible future narratives to prepare for uncertainty and improve decision-making.",
    "explanation": "Scenario planning is a strategic planning method that organizations use to make flexible long-term plans by developing multiple plausible narratives about how the future might unfold. Rather than trying to predict the single most likely future, scenario planning acknowledges deep uncertainty and prepares decision-makers to respond effectively to a range of possibilities.\n\n**Origins and evolution**:\n\nScenario planning gained prominence through Royal Dutch Shell's use of the method in the 1970s, which helped the company anticipate and respond to the oil crisis far better than competitors. The approach was refined by Pierre Wack and later popularized by Peter Schwartz and the Global Business Network.\n\n**The scenario planning process**:\n\n1. **Identify the focal question**: What strategic decision or challenge are you preparing for?\n2. **Identify driving forces**: Economic, technological, social, political, and environmental factors\n3. **Identify critical uncertainties**: Which driving forces are both highly impactful and highly uncertain?\n4. **Construct scenario frameworks**: Typically 2-4 distinct scenarios built around the critical uncertainties\n5. **Develop narratives**: Flesh out each scenario with coherent, internally consistent stories\n6. **Identify implications**: What would each scenario mean for the organization's strategy?\n7. **Develop strategic options**: Create plans that are robust across multiple scenarios\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n- Challenges assumptions and mental models\n- Reduces cognitive biases like overconfidence and anchoring\n- Builds organizational resilience and adaptability\n- Improves strategic conversations and alignment\n- Enables faster response when early signals of change appear\n\n**Scenario planning vs. forecasting**:\n\n- Forecasting predicts one future; scenario planning prepares for several\n- Forecasting works well in stable environments; scenario planning thrives in uncertainty\n- Forecasting can create false precision; scenario planning embraces ambiguity\n\nScenario planning is most valuable when facing long time horizons, significant uncertainty, and high-stakes decisions where being wrong is costly.",
