    "summary": "The deliberate process of thinking about and learning from experience to improve professional practice and personal effectiveness.",
    "explanation": "Reflective practice is the capacity to reflect on action so as to engage in a process of continuous learning. The concept was developed by philosopher Donald Schön in his influential 1983 book 'The Reflective Practitioner,' which challenged the technical rationality model that dominated professional education.\n\n**Schön's key distinctions**:\n\n**Reflection-in-action** occurs during an activity. It's the thinking that shapes what we're doing while we're doing it:\n- A musician adjusting their playing in response to what they hear\n- A teacher modifying a lesson based on student reactions\n- A programmer debugging code by forming and testing hypotheses in real-time\n- A designer iterating on a sketch as new ideas emerge\n\nThis is 'thinking on your feet'—the ability to respond to surprise and uncertainty in the moment by drawing on tacit knowledge and improvising appropriately.\n\n**Reflection-on-action** occurs after an activity. It's deliberate thinking about what happened, what worked, and what could be improved:\n- Post-project retrospectives\n- Journaling about experiences\n- Discussing cases with colleagues\n- Analyzing what went wrong (or right) and why\n\nBoth forms are essential: reflection-in-action enables adaptive expertise in the moment; reflection-on-action enables systematic learning and improvement over time.\n\n**The reflective cycle** (adapted from various models):\n\n1. **Experience**: Something happens—an event, interaction, or outcome\n2. **Description**: What actually occurred? (Facts, not interpretations)\n3. **Feelings**: What were you thinking and feeling?\n4. **Evaluation**: What was good and bad about the experience?\n5. **Analysis**: What sense can you make of the situation? What patterns or theories apply?\n6. **Conclusion**: What else could you have done? What have you learned?\n7. **Action plan**: If it arose again, what would you do differently?\n\n**Why reflective practice matters**:\n\n- **Bridges theory and practice**: Connects abstract knowledge to concrete situations\n- **Develops practical wisdom**: Builds judgment that can't be taught from books alone\n- **Surfaces tacit knowledge**: Makes implicit expertise explicit and transferable\n- **Enables adaptation**: Professionals can adjust to unique situations rather than applying rigid rules\n- **Drives continuous improvement**: Regular reflection prevents stagnation\n- **Builds self-awareness**: Understanding your strengths, weaknesses, and biases\n\n**Implementing reflective practice**:\n\n- **Journaling**: Regular written reflection on experiences\n- **After-action reviews**: Systematic team reflection after projects or events\n- **Supervision/mentoring**: Structured reflection with a more experienced practitioner\n- **Peer discussion**: Sharing and analyzing cases with colleagues\n- **Portfolio development**: Collecting and reflecting on work samples\n- **Critical incident analysis**: Deep reflection on significant events\n\n**Challenges**:\n\n- Reflection takes time that feels unproductive in the short term\n- Without structure, reflection can become rumination\n- Defensive mechanisms can distort honest self-assessment\n- Individual reflection misses blind spots visible to others\n- Organizational cultures may not support reflective time\n\nReflective practice transforms experience into learning. Without reflection, we may repeat the same year of experience twenty times rather than accumulating twenty years of growth.",
