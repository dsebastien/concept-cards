    "summary": "Organizational barriers that prevent information sharing across teams and departments.",
    "explanation": "Knowledge silos occur when information, expertise, and insights are trapped within specific teams, departments, or individuals rather than flowing freely through an organization. Silos form because of: organizational structure (departments as boundaries), incentive misalignment (rewarding individual over shared success), lack of communication channels, competitive dynamics, and simple convenience (easier not to share). Silos cause: duplicated work, missed opportunities for synergy, inconsistent approaches, slower innovation, and organizational fragility when key individuals leave. Breaking silos requires: cross-functional initiatives, shared metrics, communication platforms, communities of practice, job rotation, and leadership modeling of information sharing. However, some boundaries are healthy - complete openness can overwhelm and distract. For knowledge workers, awareness of silos helps: seek information proactively across boundaries, contribute to shared knowledge, and recognize when organizational structure creates information barriers.",
