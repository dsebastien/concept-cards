    "summary": "Initiating contact with prospects who have no prior relationship with you or your business.",
    "explanation": "Cold outreach—through email, phone, social media, or other channels—means reaching people who haven't expressed interest. Success requires: targeting the right people (research matters), personalization (generic messages get ignored), value-first messaging (lead with insight, not asks), clear next steps, and persistent but respectful follow-up. Cold outreach has low response rates (1-5% is often good), so volume and optimization matter. Modern approaches blend cold and warm by engaging with prospects' content before reaching out. For creators and knowledge workers, cold outreach might mean pitching to podcasts, reaching potential collaborators, or contacting dream clients. The key is making cold feel warmer through research and relevance.",
