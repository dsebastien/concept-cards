    "summary": "The principle that content value accumulates and multiplies over time, creating exponential returns on creative investment.",
    "explanation": "Content Compounding describes how the value of content grows exponentially rather than linearly over time. Like financial compound interest, each piece of content builds on previous work, creating accelerating returns.\n\n**How Content Compounds:**\n\n1. **SEO compounds** - Old content keeps ranking, bringing traffic indefinitely\n2. **Authority compounds** - Each piece reinforces expertise perception\n3. **Library compounds** - More content means more entry points\n4. **Network compounds** - Content attracts people who share it\n5. **Ideas compound** - Previous content informs and enriches new content\n6. **Skills compound** - Each piece makes you a better creator\n\n**The Math:**\n- Year 1: 50 pieces reaching 100 people each = 5,000 impressions\n- Year 3: 150 pieces, each gaining authority, cross-linking = 50,000+ impressions\n- Year 5: 250 pieces forming an interconnected ecosystem = exponential growth\n\n**Maximizing Compounding:**\n- **Create evergreen content** - Timeless value keeps compounding\n- **Build interconnections** - Link content together\n- **Update and improve** - Refresh old content to maintain value\n- **Focus on quality** - Bad content doesn't compound\n- **Be consistent** - Regular additions accelerate compounding\n\n**The Patience Required:**\nCompounding is back-loaded. Early results feel slow. Most creators quit before compounding kicks in. The breakthrough comes from consistency over years, not months.\n\n**Content as Asset:**\nUnlike time-for-money work, content continues working after creation. This makes content creation one of the highest-leverage activities available.",
