    "summary": "Carl Jung's foundational theory of personality categorizing people by their dominant mental functions and attitudes, forming the basis for modern personality assessments like MBTI.",
    "explanation": "Psychological Types is Carl Jung's seminal 1921 work that introduced the concepts of introversion, extraversion, and the cognitive functions. This framework became the foundation for the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and influenced virtually all subsequent personality psychology.\n\n**Jung's Core Framework:**\n\n**Two Attitudes:**\n- **Extraversion**: Psychic energy directed outward toward the external world of people, objects, and events.\n- **Introversion**: Psychic energy directed inward toward the subjective world of thoughts, feelings, and reflections.\n\n**Four Functions:**\nJung identified four basic psychological functions through which we experience the world:\n\n- **Thinking**: Logical analysis and objective evaluation\n- **Feeling**: Value judgments based on subjective worth\n- **Sensation**: Perception through the five senses\n- **Intuition**: Perception of possibilities and meanings beyond the immediate\n\nJung grouped these into:\n- **Rational functions** (Thinking and Feeling): How we judge and make decisions\n- **Irrational functions** (Sensation and Intuition): How we perceive information\n\n**Type Development:**\nEach person has a dominant function (most developed), auxiliary function (supporting), and inferior function (least developed, often unconscious). Psychological health involves developing all functions while honoring one's natural dominant function.\n\n**Key insights:**\n- No type is better than another—each has strengths and blind spots\n- People of opposite types often misunderstand each other\n- The inferior function is the gateway to the unconscious and personal growth\n- Type is about preferences, not abilities—anyone can develop any function\n\nJung's work emphasizes that understanding psychological types fosters self-awareness and tolerance for different ways of being in the world.",
