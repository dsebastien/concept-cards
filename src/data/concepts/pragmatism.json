    "name": "Pragmatism",
    "summary": "A philosophical tradition holding that the truth or value of an idea should be measured by its practical usefulness and real-world consequences rather than by its correspondence to abstract or objective reality.",
    "explanation": "Pragmatism is a philosophical movement that originated in the United States in the late 19th century, primarily through the work of Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey. Its central claim is that the meaning and truth of ideas are best evaluated through their practical effects and usefulness rather than through abstract reasoning or correspondence to an independent reality.\n\nKey principles of pragmatism:\n\n- **Truth is what works**: An idea is 'true' insofar as it is useful, leads to successful action, and produces desired outcomes. Truth is not a static property but an ongoing process of verification through experience.\n- **Ideas are instruments**: Theories, beliefs, and concepts are tools for navigating reality, not mirrors reflecting it. The value of a tool is in what it helps you accomplish.\n- **Experience over abstraction**: Pragmatists prioritize lived experience and observable consequences over theoretical elegance or logical purity.\n- **Fallibilism**: All knowledge is provisional. What works today may need revision tomorrow as circumstances change.\n\nPragmatism has influenced many fields beyond philosophy:\n\n- **Psychology**: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy adopts a pragmatic stance — beliefs are evaluated by whether they produce helpful or harmful behavior, not by whether they are 'objectively true.'\n- **Education**: John Dewey's pragmatic approach emphasized learning through doing and experiential education.\n- **Personal development**: The principle of choosing beliefs based on usefulness (rather than truth) is a direct application of pragmatist thinking.\n\nDerek Sivers' *Useful Not True* is essentially a popular application of pragmatist philosophy: judge your beliefs by their fruits, not by their correspondence to some abstract truth.",
