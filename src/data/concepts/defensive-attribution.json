    "summary": "A cognitive bias where people assign more blame to a harm-doer as the outcome's severity increases, and less blame when they identify with the victim.",
    "explanation": "Defensive Attribution is a cognitive bias that influences how we assign responsibility and blame for accidents and misfortunes. First identified by psychologist Elaine Walster in 1966, this bias describes our tendency to attribute greater blame to a harm-doer as the consequences of their actions become more severe, while simultaneously attributing less blame when we perceive ourselves as similar to the victim.\n\nAt its core, Defensive Attribution serves as a psychological defense mechanism that protects our sense of personal control and invulnerability. When we witness or hear about someone experiencing a serious accident or misfortune, it can trigger anxiety about our own vulnerability to similar events. By attributing the outcome to the perpetrator's carelessness or negligence rather than to chance or circumstances, we maintain the comforting belief that such things won't happen to us because we would behave differently.\n\nThe role of similarity to the victim is particularly important in understanding this bias. Research shows that when observers perceive themselves as similar to the victim (in terms of age, occupation, lifestyle, or circumstances), they tend to attribute less blame to the victim and more to external factors or the harm-doer. This is because blaming someone similar to ourselves would threaten our own sense of safety and control. Conversely, when we identify more with the potential harm-doer, we may downplay their responsibility to protect our self-image.\n\nThe implications of Defensive Attribution extend significantly into legal and social contexts. In jury trials, jurors may assign harsher punishments for accidents with severe outcomes compared to identical negligent behavior that resulted in minor harm. This contradicts the legal principle that culpability should be based on the defendant's mental state and actions, not on the fortuitous severity of the outcome. In workplace settings, this bias can lead to disproportionate blame assignment following serious incidents, potentially overshadowing systemic issues that contributed to the event.\n\nUnderstanding Defensive Attribution helps us recognize when our judgments of blame may be influenced by outcome severity rather than actual culpability, and when our identification with parties involved may be skewing our attribution of responsibility.",
