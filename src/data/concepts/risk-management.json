    "summary": "The systematic process of identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and mitigating risks to minimize their negative impact.",
    "explanation": "Risk management is the systematic process of identifying potential threats and opportunities, analyzing their likelihood and impact, and implementing strategies to manage them. It is fundamental to organizational governance, project management, and personal decision-making.\n\n**The risk management process**:\n\n1. **Risk identification**: Discovering and documenting potential risks through brainstorming, checklists, SWOT analysis, historical data, and expert judgment\n2. **Risk analysis**: Assessing the likelihood and potential impact of each risk, both qualitatively and quantitatively\n3. **Risk evaluation**: Prioritizing risks by comparing analysis results against risk criteria and appetite\n4. **Risk treatment**: Selecting and implementing strategies to address prioritized risks\n5. **Monitoring and review**: Continuously tracking risks, evaluating treatment effectiveness, and identifying new risks\n6. **Communication**: Ensuring stakeholders are informed throughout the process\n\n**Risk treatment strategies**:\n\n- **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk by not undertaking the activity\n- **Mitigate**: Reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk\n- **Transfer**: Shift the risk to another party (insurance, outsourcing)\n- **Accept**: Acknowledge the risk and prepare to deal with consequences\n- **Exploit**: For positive risks (opportunities), take action to ensure they materialize\n\n**Key frameworks and standards**:\n\n- ISO 31000: International risk management standard\n- COSO ERM: Enterprise risk management framework\n- NIST RMF: Risk Management Framework for information systems\n- FAIR: Factor Analysis of Information Risk\n\n**Risk management in practice**:\n\nEffective risk management is not about eliminating all risk — that would also eliminate opportunity. It's about making informed decisions about which risks to take, ensuring adequate preparation for potential negative outcomes, and creating a culture where risk is openly discussed and proactively managed.",
