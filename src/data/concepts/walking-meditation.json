    "summary": "Mindfulness practice combining slow, deliberate walking with present-moment awareness of bodily sensations and movement.",
    "explanation": "Walking Meditation is a mindfulness practice that brings meditative awareness to the act of walking. Rather than walking to get somewhere, you walk to practice being fully present with each step. It bridges formal sitting meditation and daily life mindfulness.\n\nHow to practice Walking Meditation:\n\n1. Choose a path (10-30 feet long, or a circuit)\n2. Stand still, feeling your feet on the ground\n3. Begin walking slowly and deliberately\n4. Focus attention on the sensations of walking:\n   - Lifting the foot\n   - Moving it forward\n   - Placing it down\n   - Shifting weight\n5. When the mind wanders, note it and return to walking sensations\n6. At the end of your path, pause, turn mindfully, continue\n\nSpeed variations:\n- Very slow: Detailed awareness of each micro-movement\n- Slow: Natural slow pace with full attention\n- Normal pace: Everyday walking with mindful awareness\n\nBenefits of Walking Meditation:\n- Accessible when sitting is difficult (restlessness, pain, drowsiness)\n- Builds bridge between formal practice and daily life\n- Grounding and embodied (helpful for anxious minds)\n- Can be practiced anywhere without looking unusual (at normal speed)\n- Physical movement supports alertness\n\nTraditions: Practiced in Zen (kinhin), Theravada Buddhism, Thich Nhat Hanh's tradition, and secular mindfulness programs like MBSR.\n\nPractical tips: Start with 10 minutes. Hands can be clasped in front, behind, or at sides. Eyes are open, gaze soft and downward. Practice barefoot indoors or with shoes outdoors. Can be done between sitting meditation sessions.",
