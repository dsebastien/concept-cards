    "summary": "The just-noticeable difference between two stimuli is a constant proportion of the original stimulus intensity.",
    "explanation": "Weber's Law (1834) is one of the first quantitative laws in psychology, foundational to the field of psychophysics. It states that the just noticeable difference (JND) between two stimuli is a constant proportion of the original stimulus, expressed as ΔI/I = k, where ΔI is the change in stimulus, I is the original stimulus intensity, and k is a constant that varies by sensory modality.\n\nFor example, to notice a weight difference, you need about a 2% change regardless of whether you're lifting 1kg or 50kg. For brightness, the threshold is approximately 8%. This explains why we perceive relative rather than absolute differences in stimulation.\n\nGustav Fechner extended this into Fechner's Law, proposing that sensation grows logarithmically with stimulus intensity (S = k·log I). Stevens' Power Law later revised this relationship to a power function. Weber's Law has applications beyond perception, influencing our understanding of economics (diminishing marginal utility), UX design, and any domain where humans evaluate relative differences.",
