    "summary": "Financial incentives that discourage leaving a position, trading personal freedom for compensation.",
    "explanation": "Golden handcuffs refer to financial incentives — high salaries, stock options, bonuses, pension plans, or other benefits — that make it psychologically and practically difficult to leave a position even when the work is unfulfilling, misaligned with values, or harmful to well-being. The compensation becomes a cage: comfortable enough to stay, costly enough to make leaving feel impossible.\n\n**How golden handcuffs form**:\n\n- A well-paying job enables a certain lifestyle\n- Lifestyle inflation adjusts spending upward to match income\n- Financial obligations (mortgage, school fees, subscriptions) become fixed costs\n- Leaving would require a significant lifestyle downgrade\n- The perceived cost of leaving grows while the option to leave shrinks\n\n**Types of golden handcuffs**:\n\n- **Salary dependency**: A high salary that would be hard to match elsewhere, especially in a different field\n- **Vesting schedules**: Stock options or retirement benefits that require years of continued employment to fully realize\n- **Deferred compensation**: Bonuses or payouts tied to future dates\n- **Benefits lock-in**: Healthcare, pension, or perks difficult to replicate independently\n- **Status attachment**: The identity and social standing tied to a prestigious position\n\n**The hidden cost**:\n\nGolden handcuffs create an invisible tax on freedom. The person earns more but has less autonomy, less time freedom, and often less satisfaction. They may spend years in a role they've outgrown because the financial exit cost seems too high. This is a direct manifestation of the time-money tradeoff tilted entirely toward money at the expense of time and meaning.\n\n**Breaking free**:\n\n- Build passive income streams or savings that reduce dependency on the paycheck\n- Resist lifestyle inflation to keep the exit cost low\n- Calculate your true hourly rate including all the hidden costs (stress, health, missed experiences)\n- Define your concept of enough — what income level actually supports the life you want?\n- Make the transition gradual: reduce expenses, build alternatives, then make the leap",
