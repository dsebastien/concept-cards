    "summary": "Safety constraints and boundaries built into AI systems to prevent harmful or undesired outputs.",
    "explanation": "AI guardrails are safety mechanisms designed to constrain AI system behavior within acceptable boundaries. They prevent harmful outputs, enforce policies, and ensure AI systems operate as intended.\n\n**Types of Guardrails:**\n\n1. **Input guardrails**: Filter or reject problematic prompts before processing\n   - Detect prompt injection attempts\n   - Block requests for harmful content\n   - Validate input format and length\n\n2. **Output guardrails**: Check and filter responses before delivery\n   - Content moderation (toxicity, bias, PII)\n   - Factual accuracy checking\n   - Format compliance validation\n\n3. **Behavioral guardrails**: Constrain what actions AI can take\n   - Scope limitations (what domains AI can operate in)\n   - Authorization requirements (human approval for certain actions)\n   - Rate limiting and resource constraints\n\n4. **Constitutional guardrails**: Embedded principles guiding behavior\n   - Ethical guidelines trained into the model\n   - Refusal patterns for harmful requests\n   - Value alignment through training\n\n**Implementation Approaches:**\n\n- **Rule-based**: Explicit filters and keyword blocking\n- **ML-based**: Classifiers trained to detect problematic content\n- **LLM-based**: Using language models to evaluate other LLM outputs\n- **Human review**: Escalation to human judgment for edge cases\n\n**Tradeoffs:**\n\n- Too strict: False positives frustrate legitimate use\n- Too loose: Harmful content slips through\n- Static rules: Can be gamed or become outdated\n- Dynamic systems: Require ongoing maintenance and monitoring\n\nEffective guardrails balance safety with usability, adapting to new threats while enabling legitimate use cases.",
