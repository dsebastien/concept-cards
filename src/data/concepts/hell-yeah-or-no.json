    "summary": "Decision-making principle: if you're not feeling 'Hell yeah!' about something, say no.",
    "explanation": "Hell Yeah or No is a decision-making heuristic popularized by Derek Sivers. The principle is simple: when deciding whether to commit to something—a project, invitation, opportunity, or request—if your reaction isn't an enthusiastic 'Hell yeah!', then the answer should be no. This filter helps cut through overthinking and reveals your true priorities.\n\nThe framework addresses a common problem: we say yes to too many mediocre opportunities, leaving no room for great ones. Every lukewarm yes crowds out potential hell-yeahs. By raising the bar for commitment, you protect your time, energy, and attention for what genuinely excites you. The discomfort of saying no is usually less than the regret of a half-hearted yes.\n\nSivers acknowledges this is advice for people who already have too many opportunities—those overwhelmed by options. If you're just starting out or in a position where you need to say yes to build experience and connections, the threshold should be lower. The principle scales with your situation: the more successful and busy you become, the higher your bar for yes should be.\n\nPractically applying this means: pause before committing, notice your gut reaction, and be honest about your enthusiasm level. If you're already calculating how to get out of it or hoping it gets cancelled, that's a clear no. If you're genuinely excited and it aligns with your priorities, that's your hell yeah. The middle ground—'I guess I should' or 'it might be good'—defaults to no.",
