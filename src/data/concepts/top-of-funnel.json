    "summary": "The awareness stage of the marketing funnel where prospects first discover your brand through educational, entertaining, or problem-focused content.",
    "explanation": "Top of Funnel (TOFU) is the widest part of the marketing funnel, focused on attracting a broad audience who may not know they have a problem or that you exist. The goal is awareness and discovery, not selling.\n\n**TOFU Objectives**:\n\n- Build brand awareness\n- Attract potential customers\n- Educate about problems (not solutions yet)\n- Cast a wide net\n- Start building trust\n\n**Characteristics of TOFU Content**:\n\n- **Educational**: Teaches something valuable\n- **Entertaining**: Engages without hard selling\n- **Problem-aware**: Helps audience recognize their challenges\n- **Ungated**: Freely accessible (no email required)\n- **Shareable**: Designed for social spread\n\n**TOFU Content Types**:\n\n- Blog posts and articles\n- Social media content\n- YouTube videos\n- Podcasts\n- Infographics\n- How-to guides\n- Industry reports\n- Thought leadership pieces\n\n**TOFU Metrics**:\n\n- Website traffic\n- Social media reach and engagement\n- Video views\n- Podcast downloads\n- Brand mentions\n- Search rankings\n\n**TOFU vs. MOFU vs. BOFU**:\n\n| Stage | Goal | Content Type | CTA |\n|-------|------|--------------|-----|\n| TOFU | Awareness | Educational | Learn more |\n| MOFU | Consideration | Solution-focused | Download/Subscribe |\n| BOFU | Decision | Product-specific | Buy/Book |\n\n**Common TOFU Mistakes**:\n\n- Being too salesy (turn-off at this stage)\n- Gating all content (reduces reach)\n- Ignoring SEO (missing search traffic)\n- No clear next step (losing interested visitors)\n\n**TOFU Strategy**:\n\n1. Identify your audience's problems and questions\n2. Create content that addresses those topics\n3. Optimize for discoverability (SEO, social)\n4. Include soft CTAs to MOFU content\n5. Track which topics drive the most engagement\n\nTOFU is about earning attention. You're not asking for anything—you're giving value and building the foundation for future relationships.",
