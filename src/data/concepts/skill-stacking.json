    "summary": "Combining multiple skills to create unique value greater than the sum of individual parts.",
    "explanation": "Skill stacking is the strategy of combining multiple skills to create a unique and valuable skill set. Rather than competing to be the best at one thing (extremely difficult), you become unusually good at a combination of things (much more achievable). The intersection of your skills creates differentiation that's hard to replicate.\n\nScott Adams, creator of Dilbert, popularized this concept. He wasn't the best artist, the funniest comedy writer, or the most knowledgeable about business—but the combination of 'pretty good' at all three made him uniquely positioned to create a successful comic about office life. Being in the top 25% of multiple skills can be more valuable than being in the top 1% of one.\n\nEffective skill stacking considers complementarity. Some skill combinations are synergistic: coding plus design creates a full-stack creator; writing plus expertise creates a thought leader; sales plus technical knowledge creates solutions selling. Random skill accumulation is less powerful than strategic combinations aligned with your goals.\n\nThis approach has several advantages: it's more achievable than elite specialization, creates unique positioning, provides multiple paths to value creation, and offers resilience (if one skill becomes commoditized, others remain valuable). For career strategy, skill stacking suggests investing in complementary abilities rather than solely deepening one specialty, especially once you reach diminishing returns in your primary domain.",
