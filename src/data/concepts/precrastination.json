    "name": "Precrastination",
    "summary": "The tendency to complete tasks as soon as possible, even at the cost of extra effort, lower quality, or worse outcomes.",
    "explanation": "Precrastination is the opposite of procrastination - the urge to complete tasks immediately, even when waiting would be more efficient or produce better results. Coined by psychologist David Rosenbaum in 2014, the term describes the drive to check items off the list as quickly as possible, regardless of whether early completion serves your goals.\n\n**Why we precrastinate:**\n\n- **Cognitive offloading**: Completing tasks removes them from working memory, reducing mental load\n- **Anxiety reduction**: Unfinished tasks create psychological tension (Zeigarnik effect)\n- **Illusion of progress**: Finishing things feels productive, even if premature\n- **Risk aversion**: Starting early feels safer than waiting\n\n**When precrastination backfires:**\n\n- Submitting work before gathering all relevant information\n- Making decisions before fully understanding the situation\n- Committing to plans that need to change\n- Doing tasks that become unnecessary\n- Rushing quality to achieve completion\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Responding to emails immediately instead of batching them\n- Making decisions before needed, then having to change them\n- Writing code before requirements are clear\n- Picking up a heavier bucket closer to you rather than waiting for a lighter one further away (Rosenbaum's original experiment)\n\n**Balancing precrastination:**\n\n- Ask: \"Is doing this now actually better than doing it later?\"\n- Use waiting periods strategically (let ideas incubate)\n- Distinguish between productive action and anxiety-driven completion\n- Schedule dedicated time for tasks rather than doing them immediately\n\nFor knowledge workers, recognizing precrastination helps avoid premature action that creates rework, while still maintaining momentum on important tasks.",
