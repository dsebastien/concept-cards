    "summary": "A framework for analyzing human behavior through goal-directed activity mediated by tools, rules, and social context.",
    "explanation": "Activity Theory (developed by Vygotsky, Leont'ev, and Engeström) analyzes human behavior through the lens of goal-directed activity mediated by tools, rules, and social context. The unit of analysis isn't the individual but the activity system, which consists of six interconnected components: subject (who is acting), object (goal of activity), tools (mediating artifacts), community (social context), rules (norms and conventions), and division of labor (how tasks are distributed).\n\nThe theory emphasizes that cognition is distributed and situated rather than occurring purely in the mind. This perspective connects to Embodied Cognition and Enactivism in rejecting purely mentalist views of cognition.\n\nActivity Theory is widely used in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), education, and organizational studies. It provides a framework for understanding how people use technology in real contexts—not as isolated tasks but as practices embedded in social structures, contradictions, and historical development. The framework is particularly valuable for analyzing breakdowns and tensions within activity systems, which often drive innovation and change.",
