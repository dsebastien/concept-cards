    "summary": "A sales approach where reps teach, tailor, and take control of the sales conversation.",
    "explanation": "The Challenger Sale, based on research of thousands of sales reps, found that the highest performers share a distinct profile: they challenge customers' thinking rather than simply building relationships. Challengers excel in three areas: Teaching customers something new and valuable about their business, Tailoring their message to the customer's specific context and stakeholders, and Taking control of the sales conversation, including discussions about money. Unlike relationship builders who avoid tension, Challengers constructively push back and reframe how customers think about their problems. This approach works because modern buyers have access to information—they need sellers who add insight, not just product knowledge.",
