    "summary": "The loss of potential gain from alternatives when one option is chosen.",
    "explanation": "Opportunity Cost is an economic concept representing what you give up when choosing one option over another. Every choice has an opportunity cost - time spent on one activity can't be spent on another. In PKM, this means: time spent organizing could be spent creating; time learning a new tool could be spent using your current one better; notes captured but never processed have an opportunity cost of the insights they could have generated. Understanding opportunity cost helps prioritize what truly matters.",
