    "explanation": "The Lindy Effect (or Lindy's Law) states that the future life expectancy of non-perishable things - like a technology, idea, or book - is proportional to their current age. The longer something has continued to exist, the longer its remaining life expectancy. A book that has been in print for 100 years will likely remain relevant for another 100. This principle guides content curation: prioritize learning timeless ideas over trendy new content. What has stood the test of time is likely valuable.",
