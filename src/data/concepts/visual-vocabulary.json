    "summary": "A personal library of simple symbols, icons, and visual elements for visual communication.",
    "explanation": "Visual Vocabulary is a collection of simple, repeatable visual elements—icons, symbols, containers, connectors, and figures—that form the building blocks of visual thinking and communication. Like learning words before writing sentences, developing a visual vocabulary enables more effective sketchnoting, graphic recording, and visual note-taking.\n\n**Core Elements of Visual Vocabulary**:\n\n**Basic Shapes**:\n- Circles, squares, triangles, arrows\n- Stars, clouds, speech bubbles\n- Banners, frames, containers\n\n**Icons and Symbols**:\n- People (stick figures, simple heads)\n- Objects (lightbulb for ideas, clock for time)\n- Actions (arrows for movement, checkmarks for completion)\n- Emotions (simple faces, hearts)\n\n**Connectors**:\n- Lines, arrows, dotted lines\n- Brackets and groupings\n- Flow indicators\n\n**Text Treatments**:\n- Headers and titles\n- Bullets and numbering\n- Emphasis techniques (boxes, underlines)\n\n**Building Your Visual Vocabulary**:\n1. Start with the basics (shapes, arrows, stick figures)\n2. Practice drawing common objects simply\n3. Create personal icons for frequently used concepts\n4. Build consistency through repetition\n5. Expand gradually as confidence grows\n\n**Key Insight**:\nVisual vocabulary isn't about artistic talent—it's about having reliable, quick-to-draw symbols that communicate meaning. Simple and consistent beats complex and beautiful.",
