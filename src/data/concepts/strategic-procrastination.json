    "summary": "The deliberate practice of delaying action on tasks that may become unnecessary, resolve themselves, or benefit from additional information gained through waiting.",
    "explanation": "## What Is Strategic Procrastination?\n\nStrategic procrastination is the intentional decision to delay action on certain tasks, not out of avoidance or fear, but from the recognition that many tasks will resolve themselves, become irrelevant, or benefit from the additional context that time provides. It is a form of productive laziness that conserves energy for work that truly matters.\n\n## The Insight\n\nNot all tasks that appear on your plate require immediate action. Some common patterns:\n\n- **Self-resolving tasks**: issues that fix themselves or get handled by someone else if you wait\n- **Disappearing tasks**: requests that the requester forgets about or deprioritizes\n- **Clarifying tasks**: problems that become better defined with time, making the eventual solution more efficient\n- **Premature tasks**: work that would need to be redone if started too early due to changing requirements\n\n## How It Differs from Regular Procrastination\n\n| Regular Procrastination | Strategic Procrastination |\n|---|---|\n| Driven by avoidance or anxiety | Driven by deliberate assessment |\n| Unconscious and reactive | Conscious and intentional |\n| Increases stress over time | Reduces total workload |\n| Delays everything indiscriminately | Selectively delays specific tasks |\n| Eventually requires rushed completion | Often eliminates the task entirely |\n\n## How It Differs from Structured Procrastination\n\nStructured procrastination (John Perry) is about doing useful task B while avoiding task A. Strategic procrastination is about deliberately not doing task A at all, betting that it won't need to be done.\n\n## When to Apply\n\nStrategic procrastination works best for:\n- Requests from others that may not persist\n- Tasks with unclear or shifting requirements\n- Low-stakes decisions that don't compound with delay\n- Feature requests that may be superseded by other changes\n\nIt should NOT be applied to:\n- Time-sensitive deadlines with real consequences\n- Tasks where delay increases cost or difficulty\n- Commitments made to others\n- Health, safety, or legal obligations\n\n## Practical Implementation\n\n- **Wait 48 hours** before acting on non-urgent requests\n- **Use a parking lot**: collect tasks you're strategically delaying and review periodically\n- **Track your hit rate**: monitor how many delayed tasks actually needed doing\n- **Set review dates**: don't forget indefinitely -- schedule check-ins on delayed items",
