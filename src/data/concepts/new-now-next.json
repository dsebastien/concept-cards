    "summary": "A temporal framework for balancing awareness of opportunities, present-moment execution, and future-oriented planning.",
    "explanation": "The temporal oscillation between new/now/next is where execution lives. Most people anchor to just one temporal mode, but effective execution requires dancing between all three.\n\n**New** is seductive. It's the shiny thing, the novel opportunity, the fresh idea that captures attention. The new pulls us toward possibility but can scatter our focus.\n\n**Now** is overwhelming. It's the present moment with all its demands, interruptions, and urgencies. The now demands action but can trap us in reactive mode.\n\n**Next** is abstract. It's the future we're planning for, the goals we're working toward. The next provides direction but can feel disconnected from reality.\n\nThe skill is in the dance between all three:\n- Understanding what's **new** (awareness of opportunities and changes)\n- Deciding what to do **now** (execution in the present)\n- Considering how it impacts what we plan to do **next** (future-oriented thinking)\n\nThis framework helps balance exploration vs exploitation, maintain strategic focus while remaining adaptable, and ensure current actions align with future goals.",
