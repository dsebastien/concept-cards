    "summary": "A clear statement of the tangible benefits customers receive from your product or service.",
    "explanation": "A value proposition answers the fundamental question: 'Why should I buy from you instead of your competitors?' It articulates the specific benefits, the target customer, and what makes your offering unique. A strong value proposition is clear (understood in 5 seconds), specific (quantifiable benefits when possible), and differentiated (distinct from alternatives). For knowledge workers and creators, your value proposition might be your unique perspective, methodology, or the transformation you enable. Common formats include: 'We help [target customer] achieve [benefit] through [unique approach].' Testing your value proposition with real customers reveals whether it resonates.",
