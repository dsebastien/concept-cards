    "summary": "The ability to understand and share the feelings, thoughts, and experiences of another person.",
    "explanation": "Empathy is the psychological capacity to understand and share another person's emotional state, perspective, and experiences. It is a foundational element of emotional intelligence, effective communication, and healthy relationships.\n\n**Three types of empathy**:\n\n- **Cognitive empathy**: The ability to understand what someone else is thinking or feeling from an intellectual perspective. Also called perspective-taking or theory of mind\n- **Affective empathy**: Actually feeling what another person feels — sharing their emotional experience. Also called emotional empathy\n- **Compassionate empathy**: Going beyond understanding and feeling to being moved to help. This combines cognitive and affective empathy with action\n\n**Why empathy matters**:\n\n- **Leadership**: Empathetic leaders build trust, improve team performance, and reduce turnover\n- **Communication**: Understanding others' perspectives enables clearer, more effective dialogue\n- **Conflict resolution**: Seeing situations from multiple viewpoints facilitates compromise\n- **Design**: User empathy is fundamental to creating products people actually need\n- **Learning**: Empathic teaching adapts to where the learner is, not where the teacher assumes they are\n\n**Empathy barriers**:\n\n- Compassion fatigue from prolonged emotional engagement\n- In-group/out-group bias limiting empathy to those 'like us'\n- Emotional overwhelm when empathy isn't balanced with boundaries\n- Cognitive load reducing available empathy resources\n\n**Developing empathy**:\n\n- Active listening without judgment or interruption\n- Reading fiction, which has been shown to increase empathic ability\n- Exposure to diverse perspectives and experiences\n- Mindfulness practices that increase emotional awareness\n- Asking open-ended questions and being genuinely curious about others' experiences",
