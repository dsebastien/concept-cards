    "summary": "The principle of consolidating all knowledge into a single trusted system to eliminate information silos and enable meaningful connections between ideas.",
    "explanation": "Knowledge Centralization is the principle of gathering all your knowledge, notes, and information into a single source of truth. Many people scatter their knowledge across numerous tools: note-taking apps, read-later services, cloud storage, browser bookmarks, email archives, and various other platforms. This fragmentation creates information silos that are no better than having scattered physical notebooks - ideas remain isolated and unable to interact with each other.\n\nBy centralizing your knowledge into one primary system, you create what is known as an Integrated Thinking Environment (ITE), where all your ideas can coexist, be connected, and where insights emerge naturally from the relationships between them. A centralized knowledge base enables deep thinking because you can see the full landscape of what you know, rather than having to mentally reconstruct information spread across a dozen different tools.\n\nThe benefits of knowledge centralization are substantial. Findability improves dramatically because you always know where to look. Cognitive load decreases because your brain can relax, trusting that the system holds what you need. Over time, a centralized knowledge base creates compounding value - each new piece of information becomes more valuable as it connects to everything already stored. When you have a single source of truth, you never waste time wondering which app holds a particular piece of information.\n\nThe challenges of centralization are real but surmountable. Migration from scattered systems takes time and discipline. Maintaining the habit of routing everything to one place requires conscious effort, especially when individual tools may excel in specific use cases. The key practical approach is to choose one primary tool as your knowledge hub and use integrations, plugins, or manual workflows to funnel information from other sources into it. The goal is not necessarily to eliminate all other tools, but to ensure that anything worth keeping long-term finds its way into the central system where it can be connected, discovered, and built upon.",
