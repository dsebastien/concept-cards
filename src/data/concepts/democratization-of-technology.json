  "summary": "The process by which technology and tools become accessible to smaller organizations and individuals rather than remaining exclusive to large enterprises.",
  "explanation": "Democratization of technology refers to the historical pattern where technological advances become increasingly accessible across a broader spectrum of users over time. What begins as expensive, exclusive tools available only to the world's largest organizations eventually becomes affordable and usable by small businesses and individuals.\n\nThis pattern has repeated throughout computing history. In the mainframe era of the 1960s-70s, only Fortune 500 companies could afford powerful computing systems. The minicomputer era brought units to tens of thousands of organizations. The PC revolution expanded this to millions. Cloud computing further democratized enterprise software—tools that once required Fortune 500 resources (like CRM systems, marketing automation, and document management) became available to every barbershop and small business.\n\nEach wave of democratization follows efficiency improvements that lower costs while maintaining or improving capabilities. This enables new use cases that were previously economically unfeasible. The pattern continues with AI, where capabilities once requiring teams of specialists are becoming accessible through AI agents and tools, enabling small teams to operate with resources comparable to large enterprises from previous decades.",
