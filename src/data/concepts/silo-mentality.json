    "summary": "An organizational mindset where departments protect information rather than sharing it openly.",
    "explanation": "Silo Mentality is a mindset that occurs when departments, teams, or individuals choose not to share information with others in the same organization. It creates invisible walls that block the free flow of knowledge, leading to inefficiency, duplicated efforts, and missed opportunities.\n\n**Causes of Silo Mentality**:\n- **Competition**: Teams competing for resources, recognition, or budgets\n- **Power dynamics**: Information as currency for influence\n- **Lack of trust**: Fear that shared information will be misused\n- **Organizational structure**: Rigid hierarchies that discourage cross-team communication\n- **Incentive misalignment**: Rewarding individual or team success over organizational success\n- **Default behavior**: It's simply easier not to share\n\n**Consequences**:\n- Duplicated work across teams\n- Inconsistent approaches to similar problems\n- Slower decision-making due to incomplete information\n- Reduced innovation from lack of cross-pollination\n- Poor customer experience from disjointed service\n- Organizational fragility when key people leave\n\n**Breaking Silo Mentality**:\n- Create shared goals and metrics across teams\n- Implement cross-functional projects and rotations\n- Model information sharing from leadership\n- Build communities of practice\n- Use collaboration tools that make sharing easy\n- Recognize and reward collaborative behavior\n\n**In PKM Context**:\nSilo mentality can exist within your own knowledge system when you compartmentalize information without creating connections. Breaking personal silos means linking ideas across domains and contexts.",
