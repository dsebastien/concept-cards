    "summary": "A prioritization technique where you list 25 goals, circle the top 5, and deliberately avoid the remaining 20.",
    "explanation": "The 5/25 Rule is a prioritization technique often attributed to Warren Buffett (though this attribution is likely apocryphal). The method forces ruthless focus by making you explicitly identify what NOT to work on.\n\nThe process:\n\n1. **List 25 goals**: Write down your 25 most important goals, whether career, personal, or otherwise\n2. **Circle your top 5**: Identify the 5 goals that matter most to you\n3. **Create an Avoidance List**: The remaining 20 goals become things you actively avoid until the top 5 are complete\n\nThe key insight is counterintuitive: the bottom 20 items are MORE dangerous than obvious distractions. Why? Because they're attractive enough to make your list—they seem important, worthwhile, and productive. This makes them insidious time-sinks that feel like meaningful work while actually diluting your focus on what matters most.\n\nObvious distractions (social media, TV, gossip) are easy to identify and resist. But 'important-seeming' goals like 'learn Spanish,' 'start a podcast,' or 'get certified in X' feel productive, making them harder to say no to. The 5/25 Rule gives you explicit permission—even an obligation—to decline these opportunities.\n\nThis technique embodies several principles:\n\n- **Essentialism**: Doing less but better\n- **Opportunity cost**: Every 'yes' is a 'no' to something else\n- **Focus**: Concentrated effort produces exponentially better results\n- **The power of no**: Saying no to good opportunities to say yes to great ones\n\nApplication tips:\n- Review and update your list periodically (quarterly or annually)\n- When tempted by items 6-25, remind yourself: 'This is on my avoid list'\n- Use it for career decisions, project selection, or even daily task prioritization",
