    "summary": "Considering the consequences of consequences before making decisions.",
    "explanation": "Second-order thinking is the practice of considering the consequences of consequences - looking beyond immediate effects to downstream impacts. First-order thinking asks: 'What happens next?' Second-order asks: 'And then what?' The distinction is crucial because: many decisions have obvious first-order benefits but harmful second-order effects, short-term gains can create long-term problems, and systems responses often counteract initial actions. Examples include: price controls (first-order: lower prices; second-order: shortages), antibiotics overuse (first-order: cure infection; second-order: resistance), and shortcuts (first-order: save time; second-order: technical debt). Second-order thinking is: harder than first-order, requires patience and imagination, and characterizes good strategic thinking. Practicing involves: always asking 'and then what?', considering who else responds and how, and looking for unintended consequences. For knowledge workers, second-order thinking helps: make better strategic decisions, anticipate problems, and understand why obvious solutions often fail.",
