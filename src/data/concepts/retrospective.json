    "summary": "A structured team meeting held after a project or iteration to reflect on what went well, what didn't, and how to improve.",
    "explanation": "A retrospective is a structured reflection meeting where a team examines its recent work to identify successes, challenges, and actionable improvements. It is a cornerstone of Agile methodologies but applicable far beyond software development to any team or individual seeking continuous improvement.\n\n**Core questions** (the classic format):\n\n1. **What went well?** — Identify and celebrate successes to reinforce good practices\n2. **What didn't go well?** — Honestly acknowledge problems without blame\n3. **What will we do differently?** — Commit to specific, actionable changes\n\n**Popular retrospective formats**:\n\n- **Start/Stop/Continue**: What should we start doing, stop doing, and keep doing?\n- **4Ls**: Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for\n- **Mad/Sad/Glad**: Emotional mapping of the experience\n- **Sailboat**: Wind (what propels us), anchors (what holds us back), rocks (risks ahead)\n- **Timeline**: Walk through events chronologically, noting high and low points\n- **Starfish**: More of, less of, keep doing, start doing, stop doing\n\n**Key principles**:\n\n- **Psychological safety**: People must feel safe to speak honestly without fear of reprisal\n- **Blameless culture**: Focus on systems and processes, not individuals\n- **Action-oriented**: Every retrospective should produce concrete action items with owners\n- **Follow-through**: Review previous action items at the start of each retrospective\n- **Variety**: Rotate formats to prevent staleness and surface different insights\n\n**When to hold retrospectives**:\n\n- End of each sprint or iteration (typically every 1-2 weeks)\n- After project milestones or completion\n- After significant incidents or failures\n- Periodically for ongoing teams (monthly or quarterly)\n\n**Common pitfalls**:\n\n- No action items or no follow-through on action items\n- Same issues raised repeatedly without resolution\n- Dominated by a few voices while others stay silent\n- Blame-oriented discussions that shut down honesty\n- Skipping retrospectives when the team is 'too busy'",
