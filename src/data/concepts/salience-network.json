    "name": "Salience Network",
    "summary": "A brain network that detects and filters important stimuli, acting as a switch between the default mode network and the executive control network.",
    "explanation": "The Salience Network (SN) is a large-scale brain network centered on the anterior insula and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Its primary function is to detect and filter the most relevant stimuli from the constant stream of internal and external information, then direct the brain's resources appropriately by toggling between the Default Mode Network and the Executive Control Network.\n\n**The Switching Function:**\n\nThe Salience Network acts as a neural toggle switch. When it detects something important - a potential threat, an opportunity, a novel stimulus, or a salient internal signal - it suppresses the Default Mode Network (which handles rest and self-referential thought) and activates the Executive Control Network (which handles focused, goal-directed processing). When the salient event has been addressed, the SN allows the brain to return to default mode.\n\nThis switching mechanism is essential for adaptive behavior. Without it, you would either be stuck in unfocused daydreaming or locked in rigid task focus, unable to respond to changes in the environment.\n\n**What Makes Something Salient:**\n\n- **Novelty**: Unexpected or new stimuli\n- **Emotional significance**: Threatening, rewarding, or emotionally charged information\n- **Relevance to goals**: Information pertinent to current objectives\n- **Homeostatic signals**: Pain, hunger, thirst, fatigue\n\n**When the Salience Network Gets Stuck:**\n\nDysfunction of the Salience Network is implicated in numerous conditions:\n- **Brain rot / doomscrolling**: When the SN becomes calibrated to the rapid-fire novelty of social media, it flags every micro-stimulus as salient, keeping the brain in a hypervigilant state unable to settle into either deep focus (ECN) or restorative rest (DMN)\n- **Anxiety disorders**: The SN becomes hypersensitive, flagging benign stimuli as threats\n- **Depression**: The SN may fail to disengage the DMN, trapping the brain in rumination\n- **ADHD**: Impaired salience detection leads to difficulty filtering relevant from irrelevant stimuli\n- **Addiction**: The SN becomes hijacked by substance-related cues, overriding other salient signals\n\n**Maintaining a Healthy Salience Network:**\n\nPractices that support SN function include mindfulness meditation (which trains awareness of what is genuinely salient), reducing digital noise, physical exercise, adequate sleep, and deliberately varying between focused work and genuine rest rather than constant low-grade stimulation.",
