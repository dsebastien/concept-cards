    "summary": "A design principle for dividing a system into distinct sections, each addressing a separate concern or responsibility.",
    "explanation": "Separation of Concerns (SoC) is a fundamental design principle in software engineering that advocates dividing a program into distinct sections, where each section addresses a separate concern. A 'concern' is a set of information or functionality that affects the code—it could be a feature, a behavior, or a cross-cutting aspect like logging or security.\n\n**The core idea**:\n\nRather than mixing different responsibilities together, SoC advocates isolating them so that:\n- Each component does one thing well\n- Changes to one concern don't ripple through unrelated code\n- Components can be developed, tested, and maintained independently\n- The system is easier to understand (you can focus on one concern at a time)\n\n**Examples of separation of concerns**:\n\n**Web development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)**:\n- HTML handles structure and content\n- CSS handles presentation and styling\n- JavaScript handles behavior and interactivity\n\n**MVC architecture (Model-View-Controller)**:\n- Model: data and business logic\n- View: user interface and presentation\n- Controller: input handling and coordination\n\n**Layered architecture**:\n- Presentation layer (UI)\n- Business logic layer (domain rules)\n- Data access layer (database interactions)\n- Infrastructure layer (external services)\n\n**Microservices**:\n- Each service handles a specific business capability\n- Services communicate through well-defined interfaces\n- Teams can work independently on different services\n\n**Benefits of separation of concerns**:\n\n- **Maintainability**: Changes are localized; fixing the UI doesn't require touching business logic\n- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation\n- **Reusability**: Well-separated components can be reused in different contexts\n- **Parallel development**: Teams can work on different concerns simultaneously\n- **Comprehensibility**: Smaller, focused components are easier to understand\n- **Flexibility**: Components can be replaced or upgraded independently\n\n**Challenges and trade-offs**:\n\n- **Initial complexity**: Setting up proper separation requires upfront design effort\n- **Over-engineering**: Too much separation can create unnecessary abstraction layers\n- **Communication overhead**: Separated components need well-defined interfaces\n- **Cross-cutting concerns**: Some concerns (logging, security, caching) naturally span multiple components\n\n**Cross-cutting concerns**:\n\nSome concerns don't fit neatly into one component—they 'cross cut' multiple parts of the system. Examples include:\n- Logging and monitoring\n- Security and authentication\n- Error handling\n- Caching\n- Transaction management\n\nTechniques like Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) address cross-cutting concerns by allowing them to be defined separately and applied across the system.\n\n**Relationship to other principles**:\n\nSeparation of Concerns is foundational to many other software principles:\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class should have one reason to change\n- **Modularity**: Breaking systems into independent modules\n- **Encapsulation**: Hiding implementation details behind interfaces\n- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Centralizing concerns prevents duplication\n\nThe principle extends beyond software to any complex system where managing complexity requires dividing it into manageable, independent parts.",
