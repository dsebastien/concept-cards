    "name": "First Principles Learning",
    "summary": "A learning approach that builds understanding from fundamental concepts rather than memorizing procedures or copying examples.",
    "explanation": "First principles learning applies the philosophy of first principles thinking to education and skill acquisition. Instead of memorizing facts, procedures, or copying how others do things, learners identify the fundamental concepts underlying a subject and build deep understanding from there.\n\n**Core Philosophy:**\nTrue understanding comes from grasping the 'why' behind the 'what.' When you understand fundamentals deeply, you can derive procedures, solve novel problems, and adapt knowledge to new contexts. Rote memorization, by contrast, creates brittle knowledge that fails when conditions change.\n\n**The Approach:**\n1. **Identify core concepts** - What are the fundamental building blocks of this domain?\n2. **Understand deeply** - Why do these principles exist? How do they work?\n3. **Build connections** - How do fundamentals relate to each other and combine?\n4. **Derive applications** - Generate procedures and solutions from principles rather than memorizing them\n5. **Test understanding** - Can you explain it simply? Can you solve novel problems?\n\n**Examples:**\n- **Mathematics:** Understanding why formulas work rather than just memorizing them\n- **Programming:** Learning computational thinking and problem decomposition rather than just syntax\n- **Music:** Understanding music theory to compose, not just play memorized pieces\n- **Science:** Grasping underlying mechanisms to predict outcomes in new situations\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Knowledge transfers to new situations\n- Deeper retention and recall\n- Ability to solve problems you've never seen\n- Foundation for creativity and innovation\n- Reduces the amount you need to memorize\n\n**Synergies:**\nCombines powerfully with the Feynman Technique (teaching to verify understanding), elaborative interrogation (asking 'why'), and spaced repetition (reinforcing fundamentals over time).",
