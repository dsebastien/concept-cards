    "summary": "The coordination and management of multiple AI agents, including their workflows, communication, task delegation, and error handling to achieve complex goals.",
    "explanation": "Agent Orchestration is the practice of coordinating multiple AI agents to work together effectively on complex tasks. As AI systems move beyond single-prompt interactions toward multi-step, multi-agent workflows, orchestration becomes the critical layer that determines whether agents collaborate productively or descend into chaos.\n\n**Core Orchestration Patterns**:\n\n1. **Sequential Pipeline**: Agents execute in a defined order, each receiving the previous agent's output. Simple but inflexible. Example: Research agent -> Analysis agent -> Writing agent.\n\n2. **Hierarchical (Manager-Worker)**: A central orchestrator agent delegates tasks to specialized workers and aggregates results. Scalable but creates a bottleneck. Example: Planning agent assigns sub-tasks to coding, testing, and documentation agents.\n\n3. **Peer-to-Peer**: Agents communicate directly and coordinate emergently. Flexible but harder to control. Example: Debate between multiple agents that challenge each other's reasoning.\n\n4. **Event-Driven**: Agents react to events or state changes. Highly decoupled but requires careful event design. Example: Code change triggers review agent, which triggers test agent if issues found.\n\n5. **Graph-Based**: Workflows defined as directed graphs with conditional branching and parallel execution. Powerful but complex. Implemented by tools like LangGraph.\n\n**Key Orchestration Concerns**:\n\n- **Task decomposition**: Breaking complex goals into agent-sized tasks\n- **Context management**: Deciding what context each agent needs (and doesn't need)\n- **State management**: Maintaining shared state across agents\n- **Error handling**: What happens when an agent fails or produces bad output?\n- **Human-in-the-loop**: When and how to involve humans in the workflow\n- **Cost management**: Multi-agent systems multiply API costs\n- **Observability**: Tracing execution across agents for debugging\n\n**Orchestration Anti-Patterns**:\n\n- Over-orchestrating simple tasks (one good agent beats three mediocre ones)\n- Passing full context between agents (context poisoning risk)\n- No error recovery (one agent failure cascades through the system)\n- Missing checkpoints (inability to resume from intermediate states)\n- Ignoring cost (each agent hop costs tokens and latency)\n\n**Orchestration Frameworks**:\n\nThe field is evolving rapidly with frameworks like LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, and Claude's native tool-use and multi-agent capabilities providing different approaches to the orchestration problem.\n\n**Connection to Software Architecture**:\n\nAgent orchestration mirrors distributed systems architecture: the same challenges of coordination, fault tolerance, consistency, and observability apply. Teams with microservices experience often find agent orchestration patterns intuitive.",
