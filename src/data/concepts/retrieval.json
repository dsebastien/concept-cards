    "summary": "The process of accessing and bringing stored information into consciousness.",
    "explanation": "Retrieval is the cognitive process of accessing stored memories and bringing them into conscious awareness. Unlike a computer, human retrieval is reconstructive - we rebuild memories rather than playing them back exactly. Retrieval is strengthened by practice (the testing effect) and is highly dependent on cues. PKM systems are essentially retrieval systems - they provide cues (links, tags, search) to help you access stored knowledge. Good organization optimizes retrieval.",
