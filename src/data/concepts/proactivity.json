    "name": "Proactivity",
    "summary": "The disposition to anticipate problems, initiate change, and take action before being asked rather than passively reacting to events.",
    "explanation": "Proactivity is the tendency to anticipate future needs, problems, or opportunities and act on them in advance rather than waiting for events to unfold and then responding. It is a stable behavioral pattern studied extensively in organizational psychology, particularly through the work of Thomas Bateman and J. Michael Crant on proactive personality.\n\n**Proactive vs. Reactive Behavior**:\n\n| Reactive | Proactive |\n|----------|----------|\n| Waits for instructions | Identifies what needs doing |\n| Responds to problems | Anticipates problems |\n| Adapts to change | Creates change |\n| Follows the plan | Improves the plan |\n| Reports issues | Solves issues |\n| Asks 'What should I do?' | Asks 'What needs to happen?' |\n\n**Components of Proactivity**:\n\n1. **Anticipation**: Scanning the environment for future challenges and opportunities before they become urgent\n2. **Self-initiation**: Taking action without being prompted, told, or given permission\n3. **Change orientation**: Seeking to improve situations rather than accepting the status quo\n4. **Persistence**: Following through despite obstacles, setbacks, or lack of immediate support\n\n**Why Proactivity Matters**:\n\nResearch consistently shows that proactive individuals achieve better career outcomes, higher job satisfaction, and stronger performance evaluations. In teams, proactive members reduce coordination overhead because they close loops without being asked, communicate progress unprompted, and treat the team's problems as their own.\n\n**Building Proactivity**:\n\n- **Stop waiting for instructions**: If you see something that needs doing, do it\n- **Think ahead**: Ask yourself what problems are coming, not just what exists now\n- **Own outcomes, not tasks**: Focus on the result, not just completing assigned work\n- **Communicate proactively**: Share updates before being asked, flag risks early\n- **Replace 'I can't because...' with 'I'll figure out how'**: Reframe constraints as problems to solve\n\n**Proactivity in Teams**:\n\nHigh-agency teams are built on proactive individuals who don't need to be managed step by step. They observe what's broken, what's missing, and what's needed, then start moving. Early-stage teams especially need people who think, decide, and act autonomously rather than waiting for perfect plans or explicit direction.\n\n**Caveats**:\n\n- Proactivity without alignment can lead to wasted effort or stepping on others' work\n- Context matters: some situations genuinely require waiting for information\n- Proactivity works best when paired with good judgment about when to act and when to consult\n- It should complement, not replace, collaborative decision-making",
