    "summary": "Deep human-AI integration where AI augments human cognition in real-time.",
    "explanation": "The Cyborg model represents a deeper form of human-AI integration than the centaur model. Where centaurs involve explicit collaboration with clear handoffs, cyborgs feature seamless integration where AI augments human cognition in real-time.\n\n**Centaur vs Cyborg:**\n\n- **Centaur**: Human uses AI as a powerful tool, with explicit switching between human and AI contributions\n- **Cyborg**: AI is embedded in the workflow so deeply that the human-AI boundary blurs\n\n**Examples of Cyborg Integration:**\n\n- **Autocomplete and suggestions**: AI predicts and offers options as you type\n- **Real-time translation**: Seamless communication across languages\n- **Augmented reality**: AI overlays information on visual perception\n- **Intelligent assistants**: AI anticipates needs and takes action\n- **Writing copilots**: AI generates text inline as you work\n\n**Characteristics:**\n\n- Low latency between human intent and AI assistance\n- AI learns from user behavior and adapts\n- Minimal explicit prompting required\n- Integration feels natural rather than tool-like\n- Risk of over-reliance and skill atrophy\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n- **Dependency**: Deeper integration creates stronger dependency\n- **Skill maintenance**: Humans may lose capabilities they delegate to AI\n- **Transparency**: Harder to know when AI is influencing decisions\n- **Agency**: Questions about who is really making choices\n\nThe cyborg model is increasingly common as AI becomes embedded in everyday tools. The key is maintaining awareness of the integration and preserving human agency for important decisions.",
