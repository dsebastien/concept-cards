    "summary": "Data literacy is the ability to read, understand, create, and communicate data as information for effective decision-making.",
    "explanation": "## What Is Data Literacy?\n\nData literacy is the capacity to derive meaningful insights from data and to use those insights for informed decision-making. It encompasses a range of competencies that allow individuals to work effectively with data in all its forms — from spreadsheets and charts to complex statistical models and dashboards.\n\n## Core Competencies\n\nData literacy involves several interconnected skills:\n\n- **Reading data**: Understanding what charts, tables, graphs, and statistics are communicating, including recognizing their limitations.\n- **Working with data**: Collecting, cleaning, organizing, and managing data sets in a systematic and reliable way.\n- **Analyzing data**: Identifying patterns, trends, correlations, and anomalies within data to extract useful information.\n- **Arguing with data**: Using data to support or challenge claims, hypotheses, and decisions with evidence-based reasoning.\n- **Communicating with data**: Visualizing and presenting findings in clear, compelling, and accurate ways that drive action.\n\n## Why Everyone Needs Data Literacy\n\nData literacy is not just for data scientists or analysts — it's a fundamental skill for everyone operating in a data-driven world. Managers need it to make evidence-based decisions, marketers need it to interpret customer analytics, educators need it to assess learning outcomes, and citizens need it to evaluate claims made in the media and public discourse.\n\nThe gap between data-literate and data-illiterate professionals is becoming a significant career differentiator. Organizations that invest in building data literacy across all roles consistently make better decisions and gain a competitive advantage.\n\n## Building Data Literacy\n\nDeveloping data literacy starts with curiosity about numbers and a willingness to question assumptions. Practical steps include learning to use spreadsheet tools, understanding basic statistics, practicing data visualization, and cultivating a habit of asking \"what does the data actually say?\" before making decisions. Critical thinking is essential — knowing when data is being misrepresented or when conclusions go beyond what the evidence supports.",
