    "summary": "Making decisions in advance to avoid using willpower in the moment.",
    "explanation": "Pre-commitment is a strategy to avoid using decision-making power and willpower needlessly. Pre-commitments help move toward goals by removing barriers to starting activities. Instead of relying on in-the-moment willpower, pre-commitments adapt or take advantage of the environment to make decision-making effortless, effectively making it easy to do hard things. Examples include scheduling workouts in advance, removing temptations from your environment, or using commitment devices like website blockers.",
