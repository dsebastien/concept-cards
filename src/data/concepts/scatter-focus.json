    "explanation": "Scatter Focus is the intentional practice of letting your mind wander, as opposed to directed focus or deep work. 'Not all those who wander are lost' - scatter focus lets the mind come up with ideas and make plans naturally. Research shows that during scatter focus, we think about the past (12%), the present (28%), the future (48%), and other things. This future-oriented thinking is valuable for planning, creativity, and connecting disparate ideas. Scatter focus complements deep work: while hyperfocus is for execution, scatter focus is for ideation. Building in regular periods of mind-wandering can boost creativity and problem-solving.",
