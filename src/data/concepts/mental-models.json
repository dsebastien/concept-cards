    "explanation": "Mental models are frameworks, concepts, and worldviews that help you understand how things work and make better decisions. Examples include: Pareto Principle (80/20 rule), Inversion (thinking backwards), Occam's Razor (simpler explanations are better), and Circle of Competence. Learn and memorize first principles and mental models - they're the building blocks of clear thinking. Knowledge is emergent - it lies in the connections we make between ideas, which is why mental models are so useful to develop and acquire.",
