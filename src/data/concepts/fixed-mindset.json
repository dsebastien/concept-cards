    "summary": "The belief that abilities, intelligence, and talents are innate traits that cannot be significantly developed or changed.",
    "explanation": "Fixed mindset is a concept developed by psychologist Carol Dweck that describes the belief that our qualities and abilities are static - carved in stone at birth and unchangeable throughout life. People with a fixed mindset believe that intelligence, talent, and character are fixed traits that determine success.\n\nWhen operating from a fixed mindset, people tend to:\n- **Avoid challenges**: Because failure would prove they lack ability\n- **Give up easily**: Setbacks feel like proof of inadequacy\n- **Ignore useful feedback**: Criticism feels like an attack on their identity\n- **Feel threatened by others' success**: It highlights their own limitations\n- **Hide mistakes**: Errors expose their fixed deficiencies\n\nThe fixed mindset creates a limiting cycle. If you believe abilities are fixed, there's no point in trying hard - you either have it or you don't. This leads to avoiding situations where you might fail, which prevents learning, which reinforces the belief that you can't improve.\n\nCommon fixed mindset thoughts include:\n- 'I'm just not a math person'\n- 'I could never do that'\n- 'Some people are just naturally talented'\n- 'If I have to work hard at it, I must not be good at it'\n- 'Failure means I'm not smart enough'\n\nThe danger of a fixed mindset is that it turns every situation into a test of your worth. Instead of focusing on learning and growth, you focus on proving yourself and protecting your ego.\n\nThe good news is that mindset is not itself fixed. Understanding the fixed mindset is the first step toward developing a growth mindset - the belief that abilities can be developed through effort, learning, and persistence.",
