    "name": "Dead Internet Theory",
    "summary": "The theory that the internet is now mostly composed of bot activity and AI-generated content, with decreasing genuine human interaction and authenticity.",
    "explanation": "Dead Internet Theory is a conspiracy theory and internet culture concept suggesting that the internet died around 2016-2017, and most content and interactions are now generated by bots, AI, and automated systems rather than real humans. While the extreme version is conspiratorial, the theory touches on real concerns about the internet's transformation through automation, algorithmic curation, and synthetic content.\n\nThe theory emerged from observations that: social media platforms seem dominated by bot accounts and engagement farms, much online discourse appears repetitive and artificial, search results increasingly return AI-generated content farms, comment sections are filled with spam and automated responses, and authentic human communities seem harder to find. Proponents point to the proliferation of GPT-generated articles, bot networks on Twitter/X, fake reviews, astroturfing campaigns, and algorithmic feeds that prioritize engagement over authenticity.\n\nWhile the conspiracy version (suggesting intentional replacement of humans with bots) is unfounded, the underlying observation has merit: the ratio of human-to-machine content on the internet has dramatically shifted. AI-generated text is now ubiquitous, bot traffic exceeds human traffic on many platforms, and algorithmic curation creates filter bubbles that make the internet feel repetitive and artificial. The theory reflects a genuine sense that the internet has lost its early spirit of authentic human connection and has become increasingly commercialized, automated, and artificial.\n\nThe concept relates to broader internet culture concerns: enshittification (platforms degrading quality for profit), filter bubbles (algorithmic isolation), bot networks (inauthentic engagement), content farms (low-quality mass production), and the loss of 'weird internet' culture. It raises important questions about authenticity, the value of human-generated content, and whether we can distinguish real from synthetic online.\n\nWhether or not the internet is 'dead,' the theory serves as a critique of current internet trends: the dominance of a few platforms, algorithmic curation replacing human curation, content optimization for engagement metrics over quality, and the increasing difficulty of finding authentic human communities online.",
