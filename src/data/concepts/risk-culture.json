    "summary": "The shared values, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors within an organization that shape how risk is identified, assessed, and managed.",
    "explanation": "Risk culture refers to the norms, attitudes, and behaviors within an organization that determine how risk is perceived, discussed, and managed at every level. It is the collective mindset that influences whether employees proactively identify and report risks or hide them, and whether leadership encourages prudent risk-taking or penalizes any failure.\n\n**Elements of risk culture**:\n\n- **Tone from the top**: Leadership's attitudes and behaviors regarding risk set the standard for the entire organization\n- **Accountability**: Clear ownership of risks and consequences for risk management failures\n- **Open communication**: Psychological safety to raise risk concerns without fear of retaliation\n- **Risk awareness**: Employees at all levels understand their role in managing risk\n- **Incentive alignment**: Reward systems that don't encourage excessive risk-taking\n\n**Characteristics of a healthy risk culture**:\n\n- Risk discussions are integrated into strategic planning and daily operations\n- Bad news travels fast — people feel safe reporting problems early\n- Near-misses are treated as learning opportunities, not ignored\n- Risk management is seen as everyone's responsibility, not just compliance's\n- Decisions consider risk alongside opportunity\n- Lessons from failures are systematically captured and applied\n\n**Signs of a dysfunctional risk culture**:\n\n- Shooting the messenger — punishing those who raise concerns\n- Risk management treated as a box-ticking exercise\n- Excessive risk-taking rewarded in performance evaluations\n- Silos preventing cross-functional risk communication\n- 'It won't happen here' mentality\n\n**Building a strong risk culture requires**:\n\n- Leadership modeling desired risk behaviors\n- Training and awareness programs at all levels\n- Integrating risk considerations into performance management\n- Regular assessment of cultural indicators\n- Learning from both successes and failures",
