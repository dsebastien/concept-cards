    "explanation": "E-E-A-T (formerly E-A-T) describes what Google values in content and creators. Experience means first-hand knowledge—have you actually done what you're writing about? Expertise means deep knowledge in the subject area. Authoritativeness means recognition by others in the field. Trustworthiness means accuracy, transparency, and reliability. E-E-A-T matters especially for 'Your Money or Your Life' (YMYL) content—health, finance, safety topics where bad information causes harm. Demonstrating E-E-A-T involves: author bios with credentials, citing authoritative sources, showing original research or experience, earning mentions and links from respected sites, and maintaining accuracy. For creators, E-E-A-T means building genuine expertise and making it visible through your content and online presence.",
