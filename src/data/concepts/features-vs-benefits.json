  "summary": "The distinction between what a product does (features) and what it does for the customer (benefits).",
  "explanation": "Features vs Benefits is a fundamental marketing concept distinguishing between product attributes and customer outcomes. Features describe what something is or does; benefits describe what it means for the customer. Successful communication leads with benefits.\n\n**The Distinction:**\n- **Feature:** 500GB storage\n- **Benefit:** Never worry about running out of space for your photos\n- **Feature:** 24/7 customer support\n- **Benefit:** Help whenever you need it, even at 3 AM\n\n**Why Benefits Win:**\n- People don't buy drills; they buy holes (and really, they buy the shelf they want to hang)\n- Emotions drive decisions; features inform them after\n- Benefits answer 'What's in it for me?'—the only question customers really care about\n- Features require translation; benefits are immediately understood\n\n**The Hierarchy:**\n1. **Features** - Product attributes (what it has/does)\n2. **Advantages** - How features help (what it enables)\n3. **Benefits** - Personal outcomes (how life improves)\n4. **Transformation** - Identity change (who you become)\n\n**The 'So What?' Test:**\nFor every feature, ask 'So what?' until you reach the emotional benefit:\n- Feature: Our app has AI integration → So what?\n- Advantage: It writes emails for you → So what?\n- Benefit: You save 2 hours daily → So what?\n- Transformation: You have time for what matters\n\n**Application:**\nList your features. For each, ask 'So what?' three times. Lead your messaging with the final answer. Use features as proof points to support benefit claims.",
