    "summary": "The moral and intellectual obligation to form beliefs carefully, seek adequate evidence, and maintain honest practices in acquiring, holding, and sharing knowledge.",
    "explanation": "Epistemic responsibility is the ethical dimension of knowledge: the idea that we have obligations not just about how we act, but about how we form and maintain our beliefs. Philosopher Lorraine Code and others have argued that believing is not a passive process but an active one that carries moral weight.\n\nThe core tenets of epistemic responsibility include:\n\n- **Due diligence in belief formation**: Gathering sufficient evidence before forming strong beliefs, rather than accepting claims uncritically or jumping to conclusions.\n- **Proportioning belief to evidence**: Holding beliefs with a degree of confidence that matches the available evidence, following W.K. Clifford's principle that it is wrong to believe anything on insufficient evidence.\n- **Maintaining beliefs responsibly**: Periodically re-examining beliefs in light of new information rather than treating initial conclusions as permanent.\n- **Honest communication**: Sharing knowledge accurately and transparently, including acknowledging limitations and uncertainties.\n- **Recognizing epistemic impact**: Understanding that your beliefs and how you communicate them affect others' belief formation.\n\nEpistemic responsibility extends beyond individual cognition to social and institutional dimensions. In an interconnected world, irresponsible belief formation (spreading misinformation, refusing to engage with evidence, promoting unfounded claims) can cause real harm. This makes epistemic responsibility not just an intellectual ideal but a social obligation.\n\nThe concept connects to virtue epistemology, which treats good epistemic practices as character virtues. Being epistemically responsible means cultivating habits of careful reasoning, honest inquiry, and intellectual courage. It means being willing to do the work of understanding rather than settling for superficial familiarity.\n\nFor knowledge workers, epistemic responsibility translates into concrete practices: verifying information before sharing it, citing sources, distinguishing between established knowledge and speculation, and building knowledge systems that preserve the provenance and reliability of information.",
