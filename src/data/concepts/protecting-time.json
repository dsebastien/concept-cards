    "summary": "Actively defending blocks of time from interruptions, requests, and competing demands.",
    "explanation": "Protecting time is the active practice of defending time blocks from interruption, encroachment, and competing demands. Unlike passive time management (filling empty slots), protecting time requires: saying no to requests, setting boundaries, and treating time as a finite resource worth defending. Protection methods include: blocking calendars for focus work, communicating unavailability, closing communication channels, and developing cultural permission for uninterrupted time. Protection is necessary because: others will fill your time if you don't, interruptions impose asymmetric costs (cheap for interrupter, expensive for interrupted), and important but non-urgent work has no natural defender. The challenge is that time protection can seem antisocial or uncooperative - developing skill at saying no gracefully is essential. For knowledge workers, protecting time is particularly critical because: creative work requires uninterrupted blocks, and the ease of communication means constant potential interruption.",
