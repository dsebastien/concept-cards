    "summary": "A practice of temporarily abstaining from highly stimulating activities to reset the brain's dopamine sensitivity and restore motivation for less exciting but meaningful tasks.",
    "explanation": "Dopamine detox (also called dopamine fasting) is the practice of temporarily reducing or eliminating exposure to highly stimulating activities - social media, video games, junk food, pornography, shopping - to reset the brain's reward system. The idea gained popularity through Dr. Cameron Sepah's work and has become a common strategy in productivity and well-being communities.\n\n**The Science (and the Misconception):**\n\nThe name 'dopamine detox' is somewhat misleading. You cannot actually deplete or detox dopamine - it is a neurotransmitter constantly produced by the brain. What actually happens is a recalibration of dopamine sensitivity.\n\nWhen exposed to constant high-stimulation activities, the brain downregulates dopamine receptors to maintain homeostasis. This means you need more and more stimulation to feel the same level of engagement or pleasure - a process called tolerance. Activities that provide moderate reward (reading, walking, conversation, deep work) begin to feel boring by comparison.\n\nBy temporarily removing high-stimulation inputs, dopamine receptor sensitivity gradually upregulates - the brain becomes responsive to subtler rewards again. Tasks that felt boring become engaging. Motivation for meaningful but less flashy work returns.\n\n**Connection to Brain Networks:**\n\nDopamine detox effectively resets the Salience Network, which has become calibrated to flag only intense, rapid-fire stimuli as interesting. Without constant novelty input, the SN recalibrates to a lower threshold, allowing the brain to find salience in deeper, slower activities. This also restores the healthy alternation between the Executive Control Network (focused work) and the Default Mode Network (rest and reflection).\n\n**How to Practice:**\n\n- **Mild version**: Designate specific hours or a full day without screens, social media, and entertainment\n- **Moderate version**: A weekend with only essential technology, spending time in nature, reading, journaling, and socializing\n- **Ongoing practice**: Establish daily boundaries - no phone first hour after waking, no screens before bed, designated focus blocks without notifications\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n\n- Treating it as a one-time fix rather than ongoing practice\n- Being too extreme (total sensory deprivation is unnecessary and counterproductive)\n- Not replacing high-stimulation activities with meaningful alternatives\n- Confusing dopamine detox with avoiding all pleasure - the goal is recalibration, not asceticism",
