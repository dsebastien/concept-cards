    "summary": "The philosophical approach of understanding complex phenomena by breaking them down into simpler, more fundamental components.",
    "explanation": "Reductionism is a philosophical and scientific approach that seeks to explain complex systems by analyzing their simpler constituent parts. The core assumption is that the behavior of wholes can be understood through the properties and interactions of their components.\n\n**Types of reductionism:**\n\n**Methodological reductionism**: A research strategy—study the parts to understand the whole. This is practical, not a claim about reality.\n\n**Ontological reductionism**: A metaphysical claim—complex things are nothing but their parts. Mind is nothing but brain activity.\n\n**Theoretical reductionism**: Higher-level theories can be explained by lower-level ones. Psychology reduces to biology, biology to chemistry, chemistry to physics.\n\n**Successes of reductionism:**\n- Understanding diseases through cellular and molecular biology\n- Explaining material properties through atomic structure\n- Computer science—complex programs from simple logic gates\n- Chemistry explaining physical properties\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Emergent properties may not be predictable from parts alone\n- Context and relationships matter—the whole shapes the parts\n- Loss of meaning at lower levels (a love letter reduced to ink molecules)\n- Complex systems exhibit behaviors not present in components\n\n**Reductionism vs. Holism:**\nReductionism asks: \"What is this made of?\"\nHolism asks: \"What patterns emerge from the relationships?\"\n\nBoth perspectives are valuable. Reductionism excels at mechanism and causation; holism captures emergence and system dynamics. The most complete understanding often requires both—understanding parts AND their relationships.",
