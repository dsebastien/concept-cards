    "summary": "The ability to understand, use, manage, and evaluate technology effectively and responsibly in personal and professional contexts.",
    "explanation": "## What is Technological Literacy?\n\nTechnological literacy is the ability to understand, use, manage, and evaluate technology effectively and responsibly. It goes far beyond knowing how to use specific tools or applications. It encompasses understanding how technologies work at a conceptual level, evaluating their societal implications, making informed decisions about technology adoption, and adapting to new tools as they emerge.\n\n## Dimensions of Technological Literacy\n\nIn the modern workplace, technological literacy includes several interconnected dimensions:\n\n- **Digital fluency**: Navigating digital environments, understanding interfaces, and using digital tools productively\n- **Data literacy**: Interpreting, analyzing, and working with data to make informed decisions\n- **Cybersecurity awareness**: Understanding threats, practicing safe digital habits, and protecting personal and organizational data\n- **AI literacy**: Understanding the capabilities, limitations, and ethical implications of artificial intelligence\n- **Adaptability**: The ability to learn new tools quickly and transfer skills across different technologies\n\n## Beyond Programming\n\nTechnological literacy is not about being a programmer or a technical specialist. It is about being an informed participant in a technology-driven world. A technologically literate person can evaluate whether a new tool will genuinely improve their workflow, understand the privacy implications of using a service, and make thoughtful decisions about how technology fits into their life and work.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nThe World Economic Forum identifies technological literacy as one of the top skills needed for the future workforce. As AI and automation reshape every industry, the gap between the technologically literate and those who lack these skills becomes a significant competitive disadvantage. Individuals who can effectively leverage technology, critically evaluate new tools, and adapt to rapid change are better positioned to thrive in an increasingly digital economy.\n\n## Developing Technological Literacy\n\nBuilding technological literacy is a continuous process. It involves staying curious about emerging technologies, experimenting with new tools, understanding fundamental concepts like how the internet works or how data is stored and processed, and critically evaluating the role of technology in society. Formal education, online courses, community learning, and hands-on experimentation all contribute to developing and maintaining technological literacy.",
