    "explanation": "Retargeting (also called remarketing) re-engages people who've shown interest but haven't converted. When someone visits your site, a cookie or pixel tracks them, allowing you to show relevant ads as they browse other sites or social platforms. Retargeting is effective because these people already know you—the ads serve as reminders rather than introductions. Common strategies include: showing products people viewed, offering discounts to cart abandoners, and nurturing leads through content sequences. Retargeting typically has higher conversion rates and lower costs than cold advertising. For creators, retargeting can remind visitors about webinars, courses, or products they explored, turning interest into action.",
