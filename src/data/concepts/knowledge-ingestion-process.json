    "summary": "The systematic workflow for processing consumed content into your knowledge system.",
    "explanation": "The Knowledge Ingestion Process is your systematic workflow for transforming consumed content (books, articles, podcasts, videos, conversations) into useful knowledge in your PKM system. It typically includes: capturing highlights and reactions, processing captures during review periods, distilling key insights, writing notes in your own words, connecting to existing knowledge, and filing appropriately. Without a defined ingestion process, content consumption doesn't translate into usable knowledge.",
