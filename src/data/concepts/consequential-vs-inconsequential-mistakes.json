    "name": "Consequential vs Inconsequential Mistakes",
    "summary": "A framework for categorizing errors by their impact to guide appropriate risk-taking and recovery strategies.",
    "explanation": "Not all mistakes are created equal. Consequential mistakes have significant, lasting, or hard-to-reverse impacts—a wrong hire, a major strategic pivot, a public statement that damages reputation. Inconsequential mistakes have minimal or easily reversible impacts—a typo in a draft, trying a restaurant that disappoints, or an A/B test that doesn't improve metrics.\n\nThis distinction is crucial for rational decision-making and emotional calibration. Many people treat all mistakes as equally catastrophic, leading to paralysis, excessive risk-aversion, and disproportionate stress over minor errors. Conversely, some people treat all mistakes as equally trivial, failing to apply appropriate care to high-stakes decisions.\n\nThe framework suggests different approaches:\n\n**For inconsequential mistakes:** Move fast, experiment freely, don't overthink. The cost of delay or over-analysis exceeds the cost of being wrong. Learn quickly and iterate. Most daily decisions fall here.\n\n**For consequential mistakes:** Slow down, gather information, seek counsel, consider second-order effects. The cost of being wrong justifies additional investment in getting it right. Think about reversibility, magnitude of impact, and recovery difficulty.\n\nThis maps to Jeff Bezos's Type 1 vs Type 2 decisions: Type 1 (consequential, irreversible) deserve careful deliberation; Type 2 (inconsequential, reversible) should be made quickly by individuals or small groups.\n\nFor knowledge workers, calibrating your response to mistake severity helps: preserve energy for what matters, maintain appropriate risk-taking in low-stakes domains, and apply due diligence where consequences are real.",
