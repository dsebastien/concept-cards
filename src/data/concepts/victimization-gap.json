    "name": "Victimization Gap",
    "summary": "The tendency to perceive oneself as more victimized than one actually is, or more than others perceive.",
    "explanation": "The Victimization Gap refers to the psychological tendency to overestimate how much we've been wronged while underestimating how much we've wronged others. This asymmetry creates a gap between our perceived victimhood and reality, leading to interpersonal conflicts and grievance accumulation.\n\nWhy the gap exists:\n\n1. **Egocentrism**: We have direct access to our own pain but must infer others'\n2. **Memory bias**: We remember harms done to us more vividly than harms we've caused\n3. **Attribution errors**: We attribute our behavior to circumstances but others' to character\n4. **Emotional magnification**: Our suffering feels more intense because we experience it directly\n\nManifestations:\n\n- Keeping score in relationships (remembering slights received, forgetting slights given)\n- Escalating conflicts because both sides feel more wronged\n- Difficulty apologizing genuinely (minimizing our impact on others)\n- Persistent grievances that block resolution\n\nHow to address it:\n\n- **Perspective-taking**: Actively try to see situations from others' viewpoints\n- **Self-inquiry**: Ask 'How might I have contributed to this situation?'\n- **Proportionality check**: Compare your grievances to what you might have caused\n- **Forgiveness practice**: Release the accumulation of perceived wrongs\n\nRecognizing the victimization gap helps break cycles of resentment and enables more accurate assessment of interpersonal dynamics.",
