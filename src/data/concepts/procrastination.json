    "summary": "The tendency to delay or postpone tasks despite knowing the negative consequences of doing so.",
    "explanation": "Procrastination is the act of voluntarily delaying an intended course of action despite expecting to be worse off for the delay. It is not simply laziness or poor time management, but a complex psychological behavior rooted in emotional regulation.\n\n## Why It Happens\n\nProcrastination is driven by several psychological factors:\n\n- **Fear of failure**: When the stakes feel high, avoiding the task feels safer than risking a poor outcome.\n- **Perfectionism**: The belief that work must be flawless can make starting feel overwhelming.\n- **Task aversion**: Unpleasant, boring, or ambiguous tasks trigger avoidance behaviors.\n- **Lack of motivation**: When a task lacks intrinsic reward or feels disconnected from personal goals, it becomes easy to put off.\n- **Temporal discounting**: The human tendency to value immediate rewards over future benefits makes present distractions more appealing than long-term gains.\n\n## Psychological Mechanisms\n\nAt its core, procrastination is a failure of self-regulation. The limbic system (which seeks immediate pleasure) overrides the prefrontal cortex (which handles planning and decision-making). This creates a gap between intention and action. The emotional discomfort associated with a task triggers avoidance, which provides temporary relief but increases stress and guilt over time.\n\n## Strategies to Overcome Procrastination\n\n- **Break tasks down**: Large tasks feel less daunting when divided into small, concrete steps.\n- **The 2-minute rule**: If a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately rather than scheduling it.\n- **Implementation intentions**: Plan specifically when, where, and how you will work on a task (e.g., \"I will write the report at 9am at my desk\").\n- **Remove friction**: Prepare your environment so starting is as easy as possible.\n- **Use timeboxing**: Commit to working on a task for a short, defined period (e.g., using the Pomodoro Technique).\n- **Address the emotion**: Recognize that procrastination is about managing feelings, not managing time. Practice self-compassion and reframe the task.\n- **Accountability**: Share your commitments with others or use accountability partners to create external motivation.",
