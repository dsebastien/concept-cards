    "summary": "A decision-making technique that explores the most extreme possible outcomes to clarify values and priorities.",
    "explanation": "Extreme Consequences is a decision-making technique that involves mentally exploring the most extreme possible outcomes of a decision - both the best and worst case scenarios taken to their logical endpoints. By examining these extremes, you can better understand your true values, risk tolerance, and what really matters.\n\nHow to apply it:\n\n1. **Identify the decision** you're facing\n2. **Imagine the best extreme**: What if this decision succeeds beyond your wildest dreams? What would that look like?\n3. **Imagine the worst extreme**: What if this fails catastrophically? What's the absolute worst realistic outcome?\n4. **Examine your reactions**: Which extreme triggers stronger emotions? What does that reveal about your priorities?\n5. **Find the realistic range**: Most outcomes fall between extremes - where are you comfortable?\n\nWhy it works:\n\n- **Clarifies values**: Your emotional response to extremes reveals what you truly care about\n- **Reduces anxiety**: Explicitly facing worst cases often makes them less frightening\n- **Exposes asymmetry**: Sometimes the upside is unlimited but downside is capped (or vice versa)\n- **Prevents tunnel vision**: Forces you to consider outcomes you might otherwise ignore\n\nRelated techniques:\n\n- **Pre-mortem**: Assumes failure and works backward\n- **10/10/10 Rule**: Considers consequences across time horizons\n- **Regret Minimization**: Focuses on which choice you'd regret less\n\nExtreme Consequences thinking is particularly useful for high-stakes, irreversible decisions where understanding the full range of outcomes is critical.",
