    "summary": "Guided meditation practice inducing conscious deep relaxation while maintaining awareness between waking and sleeping states.",
    "explanation": "Yoga Nidra (Sanskrit for \"yogic sleep\") is a powerful meditation technique that guides practitioners into a state of conscious deep relaxation. Unlike regular sleep, you remain aware while your body enters profound rest - hovering in the hypnagogic state between waking and sleeping.\n\nThe practice structure typically includes:\n\n1. Preparation: Lying in Savasana (corpse pose), setting an intention (Sankalpa)\n2. Body scan (rotation of consciousness): Systematically moving attention through body parts\n3. Breath awareness: Observing natural breath patterns\n4. Opposite sensations: Experiencing pairs like heavy/light, hot/cold\n5. Visualization: Guided imagery sequences\n6. Sankalpa repetition: Reinforcing intention\n7. Externalization: Gradual return to waking awareness\n\nBenefits of Yoga Nidra:\n- One session can equal several hours of regular sleep for rest\n- Reduces cortisol and chronic stress\n- Improves sleep quality and treats insomnia\n- Helps process emotions and trauma\n- Enhances creativity and learning\n- Accessible to anyone (no physical requirements)\n\nThe science: Brain wave studies show Yoga Nidra induces alpha and theta states while maintaining awareness. This creates conditions for deep restoration and neuroplasticity.\n\nPractical aspects: Sessions typically last 20-45 minutes. Practice lying down, covered with a blanket. Use recorded guidance (many free options available). Can be done anytime but especially effective before sleep or during afternoon rest.\n\nYoga Nidra differs from meditation (usually sitting, focused attention) and hypnosis (external suggestion) by being a self-aware, systematic relaxation of all layers of being.",
