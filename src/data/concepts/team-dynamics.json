    "summary": "The behavioral patterns and psychological forces that influence how teams function and perform.",
    "explanation": "Team dynamics refers to the unconscious, psychological forces that influence team behavior, decision-making, and performance. These include: power relationships, communication patterns, roles people assume, norms that develop, and how conflict is handled. Bruce Tuckman's model describes stages: forming (polite, orientation), storming (conflict emerges), norming (agreements develop), and performing (high function). Healthy dynamics include: open communication, shared goals, mutual respect, constructive conflict, and distributed participation. Unhealthy dynamics include: dominant individuals, passive-aggressive behavior, hidden agendas, scapegoating, and groupthink. Leaders influence dynamics through: modeling desired behavior, addressing issues early, creating structures that support healthy interaction, and intervening when patterns become destructive. For knowledge workers, understanding team dynamics helps: navigate complex team situations, contribute to healthy patterns, and recognize when dysfunction is systemic rather than individual.",
