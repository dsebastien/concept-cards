    "summary": "The amount spent to generate a single lead or potential customer.",
    "explanation": "Cost Per Lead measures marketing efficiency by calculating how much each prospect costs to acquire. Calculate CPL as: Total marketing spend ÷ Number of leads generated. CPL varies dramatically by industry, lead quality, and channel—a high-intent demo request costs more than a newsletter signup but converts at higher rates. CPL is meaningful when compared to: historical performance, industry benchmarks, lead quality (conversion rates to customer), and customer lifetime value. Optimizing CPL involves: improving targeting, testing creative, refining landing pages, and focusing on efficient channels. For creators, CPL helps evaluate: is paid advertising worth it compared to organic content? Which lead magnets generate affordable, quality leads? The goal is sustainable CPL relative to what customers are worth.",
