    "summary": "A process that starts small and progressively builds upon itself through positive feedback, becoming larger and more significant over time.",
    "explanation": "The snowball effect describes a process where a small initial action or event grows exponentially as it progresses, much like a snowball rolling downhill that accumulates more snow and momentum with each revolution. The concept captures how small beginnings can lead to large, sometimes unstoppable outcomes through compounding and positive feedback loops.\n\n**How It Works**:\n\n1. **Small start**: An initial event or action occurs\n2. **Positive feedback**: The result reinforces or amplifies the original cause\n3. **Acceleration**: Each cycle produces a larger effect than the last\n4. **Critical mass**: Eventually, the process becomes self-sustaining\n\n**Examples Across Domains**:\n\n- **Financial**: Compound interest turns small savings into large sums; debt spirals work the same way in reverse\n- **Social movements**: A few early adopters attract more supporters, which attracts even more\n- **Technology**: Network effects—each new user makes a platform more valuable, attracting more users\n- **Habits**: Small consistent actions build momentum, making it progressively easier to continue\n- **Business**: Early wins build reputation, which attracts more clients, which builds more reputation\n\n**The Dark Side**:\n\nThe snowball effect can be destructive too:\n- Rumor spreading accelerates as more people repeat and embellish\n- Economic downturns can cascade as fear leads to reduced spending, which causes more job losses\n- Bad habits compound just as effectively as good ones\n- Procrastination creates a growing pile of work that becomes increasingly daunting\n\n**Leveraging the Snowball Effect**:\n\n- **Start small intentionally**: Don't wait for perfect conditions; begin with what you can do now\n- **Protect early momentum**: The early stages are fragile and need nurturing\n- **Build feedback loops**: Design systems where success feeds back into more success\n- **Be patient**: The exponential curve starts slowly before accelerating dramatically\n\nThe snowball effect is a powerful mental model for understanding how small actions and decisions compound over time, for better or worse.",
