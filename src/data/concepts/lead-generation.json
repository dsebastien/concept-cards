    "summary": "The process of attracting and converting strangers into potential customers who have shown interest.",
    "explanation": "Lead generation is the starting point of most sales processes—identifying and cultivating potential customers for your business. A 'lead' is someone who has indicated interest, typically by providing contact information in exchange for something valuable (content, trial, demo). Lead generation strategies include content marketing, SEO, paid advertising, social media, webinars, and referrals. Quality matters more than quantity—100 highly qualified leads beat 1000 uninterested contacts. For creators and knowledge workers, lead generation often means building an email list through lead magnets (free guides, templates, courses). The goal is to start relationships that can be nurtured toward eventual conversion.",
