    "summary": "A dramatic principle stating that every element introduced in a story must be necessary and eventually used, or it should be removed.",
    "explanation": "Chekhov's Gun is a dramatic principle attributed to Russian playwright Anton Chekhov, who famously stated: 'If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise don't put it there.' This principle has become a cornerstone of narrative craft, emphasizing the importance of purposeful storytelling and the implicit contract between storyteller and audience.\n\nThe principle operates on two complementary interpretations. The first, often called 'narrative economy,' instructs writers to remove any element that doesn't serve the story. Every detail, character, object, or scene should contribute meaningfully to the plot, theme, or character development. Extraneous elements distract readers and dilute the story's impact. The second interpretation focuses on fulfillment: if you introduce something prominently, you create an expectation that must be satisfied. A gun shown in Act One creates tension and anticipation that demands resolution.\n\nThis concept is deeply intertwined with foreshadowing. When writers plant Chekhov's Guns throughout their narrative, they're laying groundwork for future events. Done well, the eventual payoff feels both surprising and inevitable—readers experience the satisfaction of pieces clicking into place while appreciating the craft that made it possible. The key distinction is that foreshadowing hints at what's coming, while Chekhov's Gun demands that the hint be fulfilled.\n\nThe principle also relates to its deliberate subversion through red herrings. Mystery writers often introduce elements that seem significant but lead nowhere, intentionally misdirecting the audience. However, skilled authors understand that even red herrings serve a purpose—they're not violations of Chekhov's Gun but rather tools that contribute to suspense and surprise. The difference lies in intentionality: meaningless details are failures of craft, while purposeful misdirection is a technique.\n\nChekhov's Gun applies across all storytelling media. In film, it manifests visually—a camera lingering on an object signals its importance. Video games use environmental storytelling where interactive objects often become crucial later. Television series plant seeds across episodes or seasons. Even in non-fiction and presentations, the principle applies: don't introduce concepts or data points you won't use or connect to your main argument.\n\nTo apply Chekhov's Gun effectively without becoming predictable, writers employ several strategies. Disguising the gun among other details prevents it from standing out obviously. Delaying the payoff across sufficient narrative distance allows readers to absorb other events. Subverting expectations by having the gun fire in unexpected ways maintains surprise. Multiple planted elements can misdirect attention from the true payoff. The goal is achieving that golden balance where the resolution feels earned rather than telegraphed.\n\nUltimately, Chekhov's Gun reminds storytellers that audiences are active participants who notice details and form expectations. Respecting this dynamic—by ensuring everything introduced matters and everything that matters is introduced—creates tighter, more satisfying narratives. The principle isn't a rigid rule but a guideline for intentional storytelling, where every element earns its place in the narrative.",
