    "summary": "A personality trait characterized by a preference for less stimulating environments and gaining energy from solitary activities rather than social interaction.",
    "explanation": "Introversion is a fundamental personality dimension describing how people respond to stimulation and where they direct their energy. Contrary to popular misconception, introversion is not shyness, social anxiety, or disliking people—it's about optimal stimulation levels and energy management.\n\n**Core characteristics:**\n- **Energy source**: Introverts recharge through solitude and low-stimulation environments. Social interaction, while enjoyable, depletes energy and requires recovery time.\n- **Depth over breadth**: Preference for deep conversations over small talk, close friendships over large social networks, and thorough exploration over surface-level engagement.\n- **Internal processing**: Tendency to think before speaking, reflect before acting, and process experiences internally.\n- **Sensitivity to stimulation**: Lower threshold for external stimulation (noise, crowds, activity), requiring quieter environments for optimal functioning.\n\n**Strengths of introversion:**\n- Deep thinking and concentration\n- Careful listening and observation\n- Independent work and self-motivation\n- Thoughtful decision-making\n- Strong one-on-one relationships\n- Creative and reflective abilities\n\n**Challenges in an extrovert-biased world:**\n- Open office environments drain energy\n- Pressure to network and self-promote\n- Meetings without agendas or reflection time\n- Being overlooked for speaking less frequently\n\n**Practical strategies:**\n- Schedule recovery time after social events\n- Use asynchronous communication when possible\n- Prepare talking points for meetings\n- Create quiet workspace or use headphones\n- Communicate your needs without apologizing\n\nIntroversion exists on a spectrum—most people fall somewhere between extreme introversion and extraversion (ambiverts). Understanding your place helps optimize energy management and communication.",
