    "summary": "The process of regulating emotional and physiological states through connection and interaction with another person.",
    "explanation": "Co-regulation is the interactive process by which one person helps another regulate their emotional and physiological states through their presence, attunement, and responses. It's the interpersonal complement to self-regulation.\n\nHow co-regulation works: Humans are wired for connection. Our nervous systems are not self-contained but constantly influenced by others. When we're with a calm, regulated person, our own nervous system tends to calm. When we're with someone dysregulated, we may become activated.\n\nMechanisms of co-regulation:\n- Facial expressions and eye contact\n- Tone of voice and prosody\n- Physical proximity and touch\n- Mirroring and attunement\n- Rhythmic synchrony (matching breathing, movement)\n- Verbal reassurance and validation\n\nDevelopmental importance: Infants and children cannot self-regulate - they depend entirely on caregivers for co-regulation. Through thousands of co-regulation experiences, children gradually internalize the capacity to self-regulate. Poor early co-regulation can lead to lifelong regulation difficulties.\n\nCo-regulation across the lifespan:\n- Parent-child: Primary way children learn regulation\n- Romantic partners: Couples regulate each other's stress\n- Friendships: Social support as regulation\n- Therapy: Therapist provides regulatory presence\n- Groups: Collective nervous system regulation\n\nPolyvagal perspective: According to polyvagal theory, co-regulation occurs through the social engagement system. Feeling safe with another person activates the ventral vagal state, enabling calm connection.\n\nPractical applications: Understanding co-regulation helps us recognize why relationships matter for mental health, why some people are calming to be around, and how to offer regulated presence to others.",
