    "name": "Net Promoter Score (NPS)",
    "summary": "A metric measuring customer loyalty based on likelihood to recommend a product or service.",
    "explanation": "Net Promoter Score distills customer satisfaction into a single number by asking: 'How likely are you to recommend us to a friend or colleague?' (0-10 scale). Respondents are categorized as Promoters (9-10), Passives (7-8), or Detractors (0-6). NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors, yielding a score from -100 to +100. Scores above 0 are generally good, above 50 excellent, and above 70 world-class. NPS is valuable because recommendation intent correlates with retention and referrals. The follow-up question 'Why?' provides qualitative insights for improvement. For creators and knowledge workers, tracking NPS on courses, products, or services reveals whether you're creating genuine fans or just satisfied customers.",
