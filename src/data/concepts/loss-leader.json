    "summary": "A product sold at a loss to attract customers who then purchase more profitable items.",
    "explanation": "Loss leader pricing sacrifices profit on one item to drive traffic and sales of other products. Classic examples include grocery stores selling milk below cost, printers sold cheaply with expensive ink cartridges, and free trials that lead to paid subscriptions. The strategy works when: loss leaders reliably lead to profitable purchases, customer lifetime value exceeds acquisition cost, and competitors can't easily match without similar follow-on products. Risks include customers buying only the loss leader ('cherry picking') and price wars. For creators, loss leaders might include: free courses that lead to paid programs, low-priced books that lead to coaching, or free community access that leads to premium memberships. The key is designing a clear path from free/cheap to profitable.",
