    "summary": "A self-reinforcing cycle where content creation leads to audience growth, which enables monetization, which funds better content.",
    "explanation": "The Creator Flywheel describes the virtuous cycle that successful creators build, where each component accelerates the others. Once spinning, it becomes increasingly powerful and difficult to stop.\n\n**The Basic Flywheel:**\n```\nContent → Audience → Trust → Monetization → Resources → Better Content → More Audience...\n```\n\n**The Components:**\n\n1. **Content Creation**\n   - Valuable, consistent content attracts attention\n   - Quality improves with practice and feedback\n\n2. **Audience Building**\n   - Content attracts followers\n   - Audience shares, expanding reach\n\n3. **Trust Development**\n   - Consistent value builds credibility\n   - Engagement deepens relationships\n\n4. **Monetization**\n   - Trust enables products, services, sponsorships\n   - Audience size enables scale\n\n5. **Resource Investment**\n   - Revenue funds better tools, help, time\n   - Better resources improve content quality\n\n6. **Cycle Acceleration**\n   - Better content attracts more audience\n   - Larger audience enables more monetization\n   - More resources enable even better content\n\n**Getting the Flywheel Spinning:**\n- Start with content (no audience required)\n- Consistency builds initial audience\n- Early audience provides feedback\n- Small monetization proves concept\n- Reinvest to accelerate\n\n**The Hard Part:**\nThe flywheel is heavy at first. Early pushes yield little visible movement. Many quit before momentum builds. The key is persistent pushing until the flywheel starts spinning on its own.\n\n**Compounding Nature:**\nOnce spinning, small efforts create large effects. The flywheel carries momentum. This is why established creators seem to grow effortlessly—their flywheel is already spinning fast.",
