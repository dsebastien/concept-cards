    "summary": "The systematic pursuit of accurate beliefs through evidence, reason, and willingness to update one's views.",
    "explanation": "Epistemic rationality is the practice of forming beliefs that accurately reflect reality by systematically seeking evidence, applying reason, and updating your views when new information warrants it. Unlike instrumental rationality (which focuses on achieving goals), epistemic rationality is specifically about having true beliefs. It asks: given all available evidence, what should I actually believe?\n\nAt its core, epistemic rationality requires treating beliefs as probabilities rather than certainties. Instead of declaring something true or false, an epistemically rational person assigns a degree of confidence to their beliefs and adjusts that confidence as evidence accumulates. This aligns closely with Bayesian reasoning, where prior beliefs are updated proportionally to the strength and relevance of new evidence.\n\nSeveral key practices define epistemic rationality. First, acknowledging your priors: recognizing that your current beliefs are shaped by culture, experience, and cognitive biases, not just objective evidence. Second, actively seeking disconfirming evidence rather than only looking for information that supports your existing views. Third, proportioning your belief to the evidence, meaning strong claims require strong evidence. Fourth, being willing to change your mind when the evidence demands it, even when doing so is uncomfortable.\n\nEpistemic rationality is difficult because the human mind is not naturally designed for it. We are prone to confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, belief perseverance, and emotional attachment to our views. Debates and disagreements often persist not because the evidence is unclear, but because people fail to weigh evidence against their priors in a disciplined way. Recognizing this gap between how we naturally think and how we should think is the first step toward epistemic improvement.\n\nPractically, epistemic rationality helps in every domain: evaluating scientific claims, making business decisions, assessing risks, and navigating personal disagreements. It does not require certainty. It requires intellectual honesty about what the evidence supports and a commitment to following that evidence wherever it leads.",
