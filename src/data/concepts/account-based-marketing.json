    "summary": "A strategic approach focusing marketing and sales resources on a defined set of high-value target accounts.",
    "explanation": "Account-Based Marketing treats individual accounts as markets of one, creating personalized campaigns for specific companies rather than broad audience segments. ABM inverts the traditional funnel—instead of generating many leads and filtering down, you identify target accounts first, then engage them with tailored content and outreach. Key elements include: defining ideal account criteria, researching target companies deeply, creating account-specific content and messaging, coordinating marketing and sales efforts, and measuring engagement at the account level. ABM works best for B2B companies with high-value deals and defined target markets. For creators, ABM thinking might mean identifying and cultivating relationships with specific dream clients or partners rather than generic audience building.",
