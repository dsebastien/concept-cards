    "summary": "The practice of defining a personal sufficiency threshold beyond which more accumulation adds no meaningful value.",
    "explanation": "The concept of enough is the deliberate practice of identifying the point at which you have sufficient resources — money, possessions, achievements, information — to live well, and choosing to stop pursuing more beyond that threshold. It is a counterforce to the cultural default of perpetual accumulation and the hedonic treadmill.\n\n**Why enough is hard to define**:\n\n- Consumer culture equates more with better and enough with settling\n- Social comparison constantly moves the goalpost upward\n- Hedonic adaptation means each new level of comfort quickly becomes the baseline\n- Fear of scarcity drives accumulation even when objectively unnecessary\n- Success metrics in business and career are typically open-ended (more revenue, higher title, bigger audience)\n\n**The power of defining enough**:\n\n- **Freedom**: When you know how much is enough, you can stop trading time for money beyond that point\n- **Contentment**: A defined threshold allows genuine satisfaction rather than perpetual striving\n- **Time**: Lower financial targets mean less required work and more discretionary time\n- **Focus**: Energy spent chasing more can be redirected to depth, relationships, and meaning\n- **Security**: Enough creates psychological safety — you're not always one step from insufficient\n\n**Applying enough across domains**:\n\n- **Income**: What annual income covers your needs plus a reasonable buffer? Beyond that, additional income has rapidly diminishing returns on well-being\n- **Possessions**: How many of each item do you actually use and enjoy? The rest is clutter taxing your attention and time\n- **Information**: How much do you need to know to act well? Beyond that, more information often creates paralysis rather than clarity\n- **Achievement**: What accomplishments would let you feel satisfied with your contribution? Infinite ambition prevents ever arriving\n- **Commitments**: How many projects, relationships, and obligations can you sustain well? More leads to mediocrity across all of them\n\n**Enough is not mediocrity**:\n\nDefining enough is not about lowering standards or lacking ambition. It's about directing ambition wisely — choosing depth over breadth, quality over quantity, and meaning over accumulation. It requires the courage to be satisfied in a culture that profits from your dissatisfaction.\n\nAs Kurt Vonnegut captured it: knowing what 'enough' means is a form of wealth that money alone cannot buy.",
