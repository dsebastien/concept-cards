    "name": "Equanimity",
    "summary": "Mental calmness and composure, especially in difficult situations - being with what is without reactivity.",
    "explanation": "Equanimity is a mental state of stability and composure that isn't disturbed by experience, whether pleasant or unpleasant. It's not indifference or apathy, but a balanced awareness that can hold all experiences without being thrown off center. In Buddhist psychology, equanimity (upekkha) is considered the highest of the four brahmaviharas (divine abodes). Key qualities include: non-reactivity to pleasant and unpleasant sensations, acceptance of what cannot be changed, reduced craving for pleasure and aversion to pain, and stable presence amid chaos. Equanimity develops through practice - facing difficulties without running, enjoying pleasures without grasping. For knowledge workers, equanimity provides: resilience in setbacks, clear thinking under pressure, freedom from emotional hijacking, and sustainable high performance. It's the foundation for wise action rather than reactive response.",
