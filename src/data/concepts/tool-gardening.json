    "summary": "Spending excessive time configuring, optimizing, and tending to productivity tools rather than using them for actual productive work.",
    "explanation": "Tool Gardening describes a phenomenon where someone adopts a productivity or organization tool, but at least half their time becomes configuring the tool, tending the tool, and optimizing the setup. The tool stops being instrumental and becomes a hobby in disguise.\n\nYou see this pattern with users of Obsidian, Notion, Roam Research, and other knowledge management systems. People deep into \"workflow optimization\" often spend more time perfecting their system than actually producing work.\n\n**Why the gardening metaphor matters:**\n\nReframing this behavior as \"gardening\" changes everything. Gardening isn't a failure mode—nobody criticizes a gardener for spending all Saturday in the yard and only harvesting three tomatoes. The tending is the point. The yield is incidental.\n\n**The core problem:**\n\nThe problem isn't tool gardening itself. The problem is when people think they're being productive but are actually gardening. They tell themselves a productivity story: \"This system makes me more effective. This vault is my second brain.\" The garden is justified by its output, not enjoyed for itself.\n\n**The AI disruption:**\n\nThis becomes painful when a new tool arrives that makes the output trivially achievable—no garden required. AI is doing this now. When the shortcut appears, the gardener is exposed, not to others, but to themselves. They weren't really after the tomatoes. The tomatoes were the justification. Years of careful tending, reframed as unnecessary.\n\n**The substrate-agnostic pattern:**\n\nThe cruelest part: the new tool often becomes the next garden. The same person ends up six months deep into configuring their AI setup, tending their cursor rules, curating their prompt library. The gardening impulse is substrate-agnostic. It just needs somewhere to go.\n\n**Recognition and acceptance:**\n\nIf you enjoy the process of optimization, there's nothing wrong with that—but recognize it as a hobby, not productivity. If your goal is output, evaluate whether your tool-tending time actually improves results. Often, a simpler system with less maintenance produces better outcomes.",
