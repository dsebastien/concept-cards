    "summary": "The tendency to process information in ways that support conclusions we want to reach, rather than conclusions supported by evidence.",
    "explanation": "Motivated reasoning is a cognitive phenomenon where our desires, fears, and prior beliefs influence how we seek, interpret, and remember information. Rather than reasoning toward truth, we reason toward conclusions that feel good, protect our self-image, or confirm what we already believe.\n\nTwo key mechanisms: (1) Motivated skepticism - applying more scrutiny to evidence that contradicts our preferred conclusions. We ask 'Can I believe this?' for confirming evidence but 'Must I believe this?' for disconfirming evidence. (2) Selective exposure - seeking out information that supports our views while avoiding information that challenges them.\n\nMotivated reasoning differs from confirmation bias: confirmation bias is often unconscious information filtering, while motivated reasoning involves active (though often unconscious) manipulation of reasoning processes to reach desired conclusions.\n\nCommon triggers: threats to self-image, group identity and belonging needs, sunk cost investments, emotional attachments to beliefs, and high-stakes decisions where certain conclusions are more comfortable.\n\nCountermeasures: (1) Consider the opposite - actively argue against your preferred position. (2) Pre-commit to decision criteria before seeing evidence. (3) Seek out people with different views and incentives. (4) Ask 'What evidence would change my mind?' and genuinely look for it. (5) Separate evaluation of evidence from evaluation of conclusions.\n\nUnderstanding motivated reasoning helps explain persistent disagreement despite shared evidence, resistance to feedback, and why smart people can hold demonstrably false beliefs.",
