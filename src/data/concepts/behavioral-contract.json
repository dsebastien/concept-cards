    "summary": "A formal written agreement specifying target behaviors, conditions, and consequences to support behavior change.",
    "explanation": "A behavioral contract (also called a contingency contract or behavior change contract) is a formal written agreement that explicitly specifies target behaviors, the conditions under which they should occur, and the consequences (both rewards and penalties) that follow. Originally developed in behavioral psychology and applied behavior analysis, behavioral contracts are used in clinical settings, education, personal development, and organizational contexts.\n\n**Components of a behavioral contract:**\n\n1. **Target behavior**: Clear, specific, measurable description of the desired behavior (e.g., 'Exercise for 30 minutes, 4 times per week')\n2. **Monitoring method**: How behavior will be tracked (self-report, app, witness)\n3. **Positive consequences**: Rewards for meeting the target (treat yourself, earn points, receive agreed reward)\n4. **Negative consequences**: Penalties for failing to meet the target (donate to a disliked charity, lose a privilege)\n5. **Timeline**: Start date, end date, review periods\n6. **Signatures**: All parties sign, creating psychological commitment\n\n**Why behavioral contracts work:**\n\n- **Specificity**: Vague intentions become concrete commitments\n- **Accountability**: Written and witnessed agreements are harder to rationalize away\n- **Loss aversion**: Financial or social stakes make failure costly\n- **Commitment and consistency**: People strive to behave consistently with formal commitments\n- **Monitoring effect**: The mere act of tracking behavior improves it (Hawthorne effect)\n\n**Types of behavioral contracts:**\n\n- **Self-contract**: Agreement with yourself, often witnessed by a friend\n- **Bilateral contract**: Agreement between two parties (teacher-student, coach-client)\n- **Group contract**: Team agreements about shared standards\n- **Anti-charity contract**: Pledge money to a cause you dislike if you fail (using services like StickK or Beeminder)\n\n**Applications:**\n\n- **Health**: Smoking cessation, exercise adherence, dietary changes\n- **Education**: Student behavior and academic goals\n- **Therapy**: Behavioral interventions for substance abuse, anxiety, depression\n- **Workplace**: Performance agreements and development plans\n- **Personal**: Habit formation, goal achievement, procrastination management\n\n**Relationship to pre-commitment:**\n\nBehavioral contracts are a structured form of pre-commitment device. They work best when created during a moment of clarity and rational decision-making, binding future behavior against the pull of impulse, temptation, or procrastination.",
