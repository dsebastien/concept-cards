    "name": "Quad Pattern",
    "summary": "A documentation pattern using four complementary document types: rules, processes, requirements, and references.",
    "explanation": "The Quad Pattern is a documentation and governance pattern that organizes knowledge and controls into four distinct but complementary document types: **Rules**, **Processes**, **Requirements**, and **References**. Together, these four elements create a comprehensive framework for managing how work is done, what standards must be met, and where to find authoritative information.\n\n**The four components**:\n\n1. **Rules (Policies)**: Mandatory constraints that define what must or must not be done. Rules set boundaries and non-negotiable standards.\n   - Example: 'All production deployments must be approved by two engineers'\n   - Example: 'Customer data must be encrypted at rest'\n\n2. **Processes (Procedures)**: Step-by-step instructions for how to accomplish tasks. Processes describe the 'how' of work.\n   - Example: 'Deployment procedure: 1. Create release branch, 2. Run test suite, 3. Get peer review...'\n   - Example: 'Incident response procedure: 1. Acknowledge alert, 2. Assess severity...'\n\n3. **Requirements (Specifications)**: Detailed criteria that deliverables must satisfy. Requirements define what 'done' looks like.\n   - Example: 'The API must respond within 200ms at the 95th percentile'\n   - Example: 'The system must support 10,000 concurrent users'\n\n4. **References (Resources)**: Supporting materials, standards, and knowledge bases that provide context and guidance.\n   - Example: 'ISO 27001 security standard'\n   - Example: 'Architecture decision records (ADRs)'\n\n**Why the Quad Pattern works**:\n\n- **Separation of concerns**: Each document type serves a distinct purpose, reducing confusion\n- **Completeness**: Together, the four types cover the full spectrum of 'what, how, why, and where'\n- **Maintainability**: Changes to one type don't require rewriting others\n- **Traceability**: Requirements link to rules (why), processes (how to verify), and references (context)\n- **Governance**: Clear mapping between constraints (rules), execution (processes), outcomes (requirements), and knowledge (references)\n\n**Applying the Quad Pattern**:\n\nThis pattern is particularly valuable in regulated environments, quality management systems, compliance programs, and mature engineering organizations where clarity about what must be done, how to do it, what standards apply, and where to find more information is essential.",
