    "explanation": "Coping skills are the strategies, behaviors, and techniques people use to manage stress, difficult emotions, and challenging situations. Effective coping helps maintain psychological well-being and prevents problems from escalating.\n\nTwo main categories:\n\n1. Problem-focused coping: Addressing the source of stress directly\n   - Problem-solving and planning\n   - Seeking information or help\n   - Taking action to change the situation\n   - Time management and prioritization\n   - Setting boundaries\n\n2. Emotion-focused coping: Managing emotional responses when you can't change the situation\n   - Relaxation techniques (breathing, meditation)\n   - Emotional expression (journaling, talking)\n   - Cognitive reframing (changing perspective)\n   - Distraction and self-soothing\n   - Seeking social support\n   - Acceptance and mindfulness\n\nHealthy vs. unhealthy coping:\n\nHealthy: Exercise, talking to friends, journaling, relaxation, problem-solving, seeking help\n\nUnhealthy: Substance use, avoidance, denial, self-harm, aggression, excessive sleeping, emotional eating\n\nBuilding a coping toolkit:\n- Identify your current coping patterns (healthy and unhealthy)\n- Learn and practice new techniques when calm\n- Match coping strategies to situations\n- Have multiple options available\n- Recognize when to use which type\n\nCoping flexibility: Research shows that having a range of coping strategies and knowing when to use each one predicts better outcomes than rigidly applying one approach.\n\nFor knowledge workers: Common stressors (deadlines, uncertainty, cognitive overload) benefit from both problem-focused (planning, prioritization) and emotion-focused (stress management, boundaries) approaches.",
