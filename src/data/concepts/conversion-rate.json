    "summary": "The percentage of visitors or leads who complete a desired action.",
    "explanation": "Conversion rate measures the effectiveness of your marketing and sales efforts by calculating what percentage of people take a desired action. Calculate it as: (Number of conversions / Total visitors) × 100. 'Conversion' can mean different things—signing up for a newsletter, purchasing a product, booking a call, or any measurable goal. Industry benchmarks vary widely, but even small improvements compound significantly. A 2% to 3% improvement might double your results over time. Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) involves testing and improving elements like headlines, copy, design, pricing, and calls-to-action. For creators, tracking conversion rates at each funnel stage reveals where to focus optimization efforts.",
