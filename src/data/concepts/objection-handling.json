    "summary": "The skill of addressing customer concerns and resistance during sales conversations.",
    "explanation": "Objection handling transforms potential deal-breakers into opportunities for deeper understanding. Common objections fall into categories: price ('too expensive'), timing ('not now'), authority ('need to check with others'), need ('we're fine as is'), and trust ('not sure about you'). Effective handling follows a pattern: listen fully without interrupting, acknowledge the concern, ask clarifying questions, respond with relevant information, and confirm resolution. The key mindset shift is viewing objections as requests for more information rather than rejections. Often, objections reveal what matters most to the buyer. For creators, handling objections well in sales pages, emails, and conversations directly impacts conversion rates.",
