    "summary": "The practice of recording daily habit completion to build consistency and accountability.",
    "explanation": "Habit tracking is the practice of systematically recording whether you completed specific habits each day. Unlike habit stacking (which links habits together), habit tracking focuses on measurement and accountability. The core mechanism is simple: mark an X, check a box, or fill a square for each day you complete a habit. This creates a visual chain that motivates continuation—the 'don't break the chain' effect attributed to Jerry Seinfeld. Methods include: paper trackers (bullet journals, printed templates), apps (Habitica, Streaks, Loop), spreadsheets, and calendar marking. Benefits include: increased awareness of actual behavior versus intentions, motivation through visible progress, identification of patterns (which days you struggle, what disrupts habits), and the mere measurement effect (tracking itself improves compliance). Best practices: start with 1-3 habits maximum, track immediately after completion, review weekly to spot trends, celebrate streaks but don't let a broken streak derail you entirely, and focus on consistency over perfection. Common pitfalls include tracking too many habits, obsessing over perfect streaks, and tracking without acting on insights. For knowledge workers, habit tracking is valuable for building routines around learning, writing, exercise, and other behaviors that compound over time.",
