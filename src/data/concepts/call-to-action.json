    "summary": "A prompt that encourages the audience to take a specific, immediate action.",
    "explanation": "A Call to Action is the bridge between passive consumption and active engagement. It explicitly tells your audience what to do next—'Buy now,' 'Sign up,' 'Download the guide,' 'Book a call.' Effective CTAs are specific (clear about the action), urgent (reason to act now), benefit-oriented (what they'll get), and visually prominent. Without CTAs, even interested prospects may not know what step to take or may postpone indefinitely. For creators and knowledge workers, every piece of content should have a purpose and corresponding CTA, whether that's subscribing, sharing, purchasing, or simply reading another article. Test different CTAs—wording, placement, color, and size all impact conversion rates.",
