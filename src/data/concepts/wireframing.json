    "summary": "Creating simplified visual guides that represent the skeletal structure of a user interface, focusing on layout and functionality rather than visual design.",
    "explanation": "Wireframing is the practice of creating low-fidelity representations of user interfaces that focus on structure, content hierarchy, and functionality rather than visual design. Wireframes serve as blueprints for digital products.\n\n**What Wireframes Show**:\n\n- Page layout and structure\n- Content placement and hierarchy\n- Navigation elements\n- Functional components (buttons, forms)\n- Spacing and grouping\n- User flow between screens\n\n**What Wireframes Don't Show**:\n\n- Colors and branding\n- Typography choices\n- Images and graphics\n- Final visual polish\n- Animation and interactions\n\n**Fidelity Levels**:\n\n**Low-Fidelity**:\n- Quick sketches, often on paper\n- Boxes, lines, and placeholders\n- Used for early exploration\n- Minutes to create\n\n**Mid-Fidelity**:\n- Digital but still grayscale\n- More accurate proportions\n- Basic annotations\n- Used for stakeholder review\n\n**High-Fidelity**:\n- Closer to final layout\n- May include some styling\n- Detailed interactions\n- Used for user testing\n\n**Benefits of Wireframing**:\n\n1. **Fast iteration**: Changes are cheap before coding\n2. **Focus on structure**: Separates layout from aesthetics\n3. **Communication**: Aligns team on functionality\n4. **Early feedback**: Catch problems before investment\n5. **Documentation**: Reference for development\n\n**Wireframing Process**:\n\n1. List content and features needed\n2. Sketch rough layouts (multiple options)\n3. Refine chosen direction\n4. Add annotations explaining behavior\n5. Review with stakeholders\n6. Iterate based on feedback\n7. Hand off for visual design\n\n**Common Elements**:\n\n- Rectangles for images/video\n- Lines for text\n- X-boxes for placeholder images\n- Gray boxes for content areas\n- Annotations for interactions\n\n**Tools**: Balsamiq, Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, Whimsical, paper and pen\n\nWireframing is about making decisions visible and testable before committing to expensive development work.",
