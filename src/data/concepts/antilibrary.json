    "summary": "A collection of unread books representing knowledge yet to be acquired.",
    "explanation": "The Antilibrary, a concept popularized by Nassim Taleb, is the collection of books you own but haven't read. Rather than a sign of failure, an antilibrary represents the humbling reminder of how much you don't know - the knowledge you could potentially acquire. The value of unread books is in their potential. Similarly, a PKM system can include references to resources you haven't fully consumed yet, representing learning opportunities rather than backlogs to feel guilty about.",
