    "summary": "A structured problem-solving and decision-making methodology using systematic analysis to identify root causes and evaluate alternatives.",
    "explanation": "The Kepner-Tregoe (KT) method is a structured approach to problem-solving and decision-making developed by Charles Kepner and Benjamin Tregoe in the 1960s. It provides four distinct analytical processes that can be used independently or together to address complex issues systematically.\n\n**The four processes**:\n\n1. **Situation Appraisal (SA)**: Clarifying and prioritizing concerns\n   - Break complex situations into manageable components\n   - Set priorities based on urgency, seriousness, and growth potential\n   - Determine which analytical process to apply to each concern\n\n2. **Problem Analysis (PA)**: Finding the root cause of deviations\n   - Define the problem precisely using IS/IS NOT comparisons\n   - Identify distinctions and changes that could explain the deviation\n   - Develop and test possible causes against the specification\n   - Verify the true cause\n\n3. **Decision Analysis (DA)**: Making choices\n   - Clarify the purpose and establish objectives (musts vs. wants)\n   - Generate alternatives\n   - Evaluate alternatives against objectives\n   - Assess risks of the best alternatives\n   - Make a balanced choice\n\n4. **Potential Problem/Opportunity Analysis (PPOA)**: Protecting plans\n   - Identify what could go wrong (or right) with a plan\n   - Determine likely causes of potential problems\n   - Take preventive actions\n   - Prepare contingent actions and triggers\n\n**Strengths of the KT method**:\n\n- Highly structured, reducing the chance of overlooking important factors\n- The IS/IS NOT technique in Problem Analysis is particularly powerful for isolating root causes\n- Provides a common language and framework for teams\n- Separates problem analysis from decision-making, avoiding premature solutions\n\n**When to use it**: Complex technical problems, high-stakes decisions, situations where systematic analysis is more appropriate than intuition, and when teams need a shared analytical framework.",
