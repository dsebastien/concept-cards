    "explanation": "Revenge bedtime procrastination (報復性熬夜) is a phenomenon where people sacrifice sleep to gain leisure time, particularly after days with little control over their schedule. The 'revenge' aspect captures the feeling of reclaiming time that was taken during the day.\n\n**Why it happens:**\n\n- **Autonomy deprivation**: Days filled with obligations leave no time for yourself\n- **Delayed gratification exhaustion**: After being responsible all day, self-control depletes\n- **Identity maintenance**: Personal interests and hobbies define who you are\n- **Scarcity mindset**: Nighttime feels like the only 'yours' time\n\n**Common patterns:**\n\n- Scrolling social media late at night after busy workdays\n- Binge-watching shows despite early morning commitments\n- Staying up for hobbies neglected during the day\n- Feeling the night is 'stolen time' worth protecting\n\n**The cost:**\n\n- Chronic sleep deprivation affecting cognition and health\n- Reduced next-day productivity, creating a vicious cycle\n- Accumulated sleep debt with compound effects\n- Impaired self-regulation, making the pattern harder to break\n\n**Breaking the cycle:**\n\n- **Schedule protected personal time** during the day\n- **Set boundaries** on work and obligations\n- **Recognize the trade-off**: tomorrow's energy for tonight's leisure\n- **Create morning rituals** that give you personal time before the day takes over\n- **Address the root cause**: lack of autonomy, not just the sleep behavior\n\n**For knowledge workers:**\n\nRevenge bedtime procrastination often signals work-life balance issues. Rather than just trying to sleep earlier, examine whether your days allow for adequate personal time and autonomy. The behavior is a symptom of schedule design problems, not just poor sleep hygiene.",
