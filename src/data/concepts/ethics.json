    "summary": "The branch of philosophy that studies concepts of right and wrong conduct, examining how we ought to act and what constitutes a good life.",
    "explanation": "Ethics, also known as moral philosophy, studies what is right and wrong, good and bad, and how we should act. It provides frameworks for evaluating moral decisions and understanding our obligations to others.\n\nMajor ethical frameworks offer different approaches to moral reasoning:\n\n- **Consequentialism** (including utilitarianism): Judges actions by their outcomes, seeking to maximize well-being or minimize harm\n- **Deontology**: Judges actions by adherence to moral rules and duties, regardless of consequences (associated with Kant)\n- **Virtue Ethics**: Focuses on cultivating good character traits rather than following rules (associated with Aristotle)\n- **Care Ethics**: Emphasizes maintaining relationships and responding to the needs of particular others\n\nApplied ethics addresses specific domains including bioethics (medical and biological issues), business ethics (corporate conduct), technology ethics (digital and AI issues), and environmental ethics (our relationship with nature).\n\nKey debates in ethics include: Is morality objective or culturally relative? Do intentions or consequences matter more? How do we weigh competing values when they conflict? These questions connect ethics to practical decision-making in everyday life and inform behavioral design.",
