    "summary": "A sales approach focused on understanding customer needs and providing tailored solutions as a trusted advisor.",
    "explanation": "Consultative selling shifts the salesperson's role from product pusher to trusted advisor. Instead of leading with features and benefits, consultative sellers invest time understanding the customer's situation, challenges, goals, and constraints. They ask probing questions, listen actively, and only then recommend solutions—sometimes even suggesting competitors if that's the better fit. This builds trust and long-term relationships. The approach requires deep product knowledge, industry expertise, and genuine curiosity about customer problems. For knowledge workers and creators, consultative selling means understanding what transformation your audience needs before prescribing your solution. It's slower initially but creates loyal customers and referrals.",
