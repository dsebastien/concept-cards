    "summary": "Attracting customers through valuable content and experiences rather than interruptive advertising.",
    "explanation": "Inbound marketing draws customers in by creating content they're actively seeking, rather than pushing messages out through ads. The methodology follows stages: Attract (bring visitors through SEO, content, social), Convert (turn visitors into leads through offers and forms), Close (nurture leads into customers), and Delight (turn customers into promoters). Key tactics include: blogging, SEO, social media, lead magnets, email nurturing, and marketing automation. Inbound contrasts with outbound (cold calls, ads, trade shows) which interrupts rather than attracts. For creators and knowledge workers, inbound marketing is often the primary strategy—your content attracts your audience, demonstrates expertise, and creates natural pathways to products and services.",
