    "summary": "The level and type of risk an organization or individual is willing to accept in pursuit of their objectives.",
    "explanation": "Risk appetite defines the amount and type of risk that an organization or individual is prepared to pursue, retain, or take in order to achieve objectives. It provides a framework for decision-making about which risks are acceptable and which are not.\n\n**Risk appetite vs. risk tolerance**:\n\n- **Risk appetite**: The broad level of risk an entity is willing to accept (strategic, high-level)\n- **Risk tolerance**: The specific acceptable variation in performance relative to objectives (tactical, operational)\n- Example: A company's risk appetite might accept moderate market risk, while its risk tolerance specifies it will not invest more than 20% of assets in emerging markets\n\n**Components of risk appetite**:\n\n- **Risk capacity**: The maximum amount of risk an entity can absorb\n- **Risk appetite statement**: A formal articulation of the types and levels of risk acceptable\n- **Risk limits**: Specific quantitative boundaries for risk-taking\n- **Risk thresholds**: Trigger points that escalate risk decisions to higher authority\n\n**Why risk appetite matters**:\n\n- Guides strategic planning and resource allocation\n- Enables consistent decision-making across the organization\n- Helps avoid both excessive caution and reckless risk-taking\n- Provides a basis for performance measurement and accountability\n- Facilitates communication about risk between stakeholders\n\n**Setting risk appetite**:\n\n- Assess organizational capacity to absorb losses\n- Consider stakeholder expectations and regulatory requirements\n- Align with strategic objectives and competitive positioning\n- Review and adjust periodically as circumstances change\n- Document clearly and communicate broadly",
