    "name": "Specialization",
    "summary": "Focusing on a narrow range of activities to achieve greater efficiency, expertise, and quality.",
    "explanation": "Specialization is the concentration of effort on a particular activity, skill, or field rather than spreading resources across many areas. In economics, Adam Smith demonstrated how specialization and division of labor dramatically increase productivity - his famous pin factory example showed workers producing far more pins when each specialized in one task. Benefits of specialization include: deeper expertise, greater efficiency through practice, ability to command premium prices for rare skills, and clearer market positioning. Drawbacks include: vulnerability to market changes, loss of flexibility, and risk of obsolescence if the specialty becomes irrelevant. The optimal level of specialization depends on market conditions, personal interests, and the nature of the work. Knowledge workers face the specialist vs. generalist tradeoff - specialists command higher rates but generalists have more flexibility. Many successful professionals combine deep expertise in one area with breadth across related fields (T-shaped skills).",
