    "name": "12 Week Year",
    "summary": "A goal-setting and execution system that compresses annual planning into 12-week cycles to increase urgency, focus, and accountability.",
    "explanation": "The 12 Week Year (12WY) is a productivity and execution system developed by Brian P. Moran and Michael Lennington. It redefines 'a year' as 12 weeks instead of 12 months, creating a sense of urgency that combats the complacency inherent in annual planning.\n\n## The core problem\n\nWith annual goals, people typically coast through the first 9 months and scramble in the final quarter. The annual timeline creates a false sense of abundance - there's always 'more time.' By week 40 of a 52-week year, urgency finally kicks in and productivity spikes. The 12 Week Year makes every week feel like that Q4 urgency.\n\n## How it works\n\n### 1. Vision\nStart with a compelling long-term vision (3+ years) that gives emotional weight to your goals. Without a vision, the 12-week plan lacks purpose.\n\n### 2. 12-Week Plan\nSet 1-3 goals for the 12-week period. Each goal has specific, measurable tactics - the weekly actions needed to achieve it.\n\nExample:\n- **Goal**: Publish a technical book\n- **Tactic 1**: Write 2,000 words per weekday\n- **Tactic 2**: Review and edit one chapter per week\n- **Tactic 3**: Share one draft chapter with reviewers weekly\n\n### 3. Weekly Plan\nEach Monday, plan the specific tactics to execute that week. This bridges the gap between the 12-week plan and daily action.\n\n### 4. Scoring\nTrack execution weekly using a simple formula:\n\n**Score = (Tactics completed / Tactics planned) x 100**\n\n- **85%+**: On track for greatness\n- **70-84%**: Good, but leaving results on the table\n- **Below 70%**: Execution breakdown - diagnose and fix\n\nNote: this scores *execution* (did you do the actions), not outcomes. You control your actions, not results.\n\n### 5. Weekly Accountability Meeting\nMeet with an accountability partner or group weekly to:\n- Report your score\n- Share what went well and what didn't\n- Commit to next week's plan\n\n### 6. 13th Week\nThe 13th week is a recovery and planning week:\n- Celebrate wins\n- Evaluate what worked\n- Plan the next 12-week year\n- Rest and recharge\n\n## Key principles\n\n- **Execution over planning** - A mediocre plan executed consistently beats a brilliant plan ignored\n- **Lead measures over lag measures** - Track the actions (writing 2,000 words) not just the outcomes (book published)\n- **Intentional imbalance** - Choose to go all-in on your priorities rather than trying to balance everything\n- **Accountability** - External accountability dramatically increases follow-through\n- **Emotional connection** - Your vision must create genuine desire, not just intellectual interest\n\n## Why 12 weeks works\n\n- **Urgency** - 12 weeks is short enough that every week matters\n- **Visibility** - You can see the end from the beginning\n- **Focus** - Forces ruthless prioritization (only 1-3 goals)\n- **Feedback** - Weekly scoring provides rapid feedback on execution\n- **Fresh starts** - Four 'new years' per calendar year instead of one\n- **Reduced planning fallacy** - Shorter horizons produce more accurate forecasts",
