    "name": "Crowdsourcing",
    "summary": "Obtaining work, ideas, or funding from a large, distributed group of people, typically via online platforms.",
    "explanation": "Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining services, ideas, content, or funding by soliciting contributions from a large group of people, particularly from an online community, rather than from traditional employees or suppliers. The term was coined by Jeff Howe in a 2006 Wired magazine article, blending 'crowd' and 'outsourcing' to describe how the internet enables organizations to tap into the collective intelligence and labor of distributed groups.\n\nCrowdsourcing takes many forms depending on what is being sought. Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo allow creators to raise money from many small contributors. Microtask platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk break large jobs into small pieces distributed to thousands of workers. Idea contests and innovation challenges invite solutions from anyone, often offering prizes for winning submissions. Open-source software development harnesses volunteer contributions to build complex systems. Citizen science projects engage the public in data collection and analysis.\n\nThe power of crowdsourcing lies in its ability to access diverse perspectives, skills, and resources that would be impossible to assemble within a single organization. It leverages the wisdom of crowds principle: under the right conditions, aggregate judgments from diverse, independent contributors often outperform expert opinions. Successful crowdsourcing requires clear task definition, appropriate incentives (monetary, recognition, or intrinsic motivation), quality control mechanisms, and platforms that facilitate coordination.\n\nChallenges include ensuring work quality, managing intellectual property rights, providing fair compensation, and avoiding exploitation. Critics note that crowdsourcing can undercut professional wages and create precarious work conditions. Despite these concerns, crowdsourcing has transformed industries from software development to scientific research, enabling projects that would otherwise be impossible.",
