    "summary": "The accumulated digital clutter and debris from everyday technology use that builds up across devices, accounts, and systems.",
    "explanation": "Digital dust refers to the gradual accumulation of unused, forgotten, or redundant digital artifacts that build up across our devices, accounts, cloud services, and systems. Just as physical dust settles on surfaces over time, digital dust accumulates in the form of old files, dormant accounts, unused apps, outdated bookmarks, stale notifications, redundant backups, and forgotten subscriptions.\n\n**Forms of digital dust:**\n\n- **File dust**: Downloaded files never opened again, duplicate photos, old screenshots, temporary files that became permanent\n- **Account dust**: Dormant social media profiles, forgotten service registrations, unused app accounts\n- **Communication dust**: Unread newsletters, old chat histories, archived emails never revisited\n- **App dust**: Installed but unused applications, browser extensions, widgets\n- **Knowledge dust**: Bookmarked articles never read, saved links gone stale, clipped content never processed\n- **Configuration dust**: Outdated settings, orphaned integrations, deprecated API connections\n\n**Why digital dust matters:**\n\n- **Security risk**: Old accounts with reused passwords become attack vectors\n- **Cognitive load**: Knowing you have unprocessed digital clutter creates low-grade anxiety\n- **Storage costs**: Accumulated data consumes paid cloud storage\n- **Search pollution**: Important content gets buried under irrelevant results\n- **Privacy exposure**: Forgotten accounts may contain personal data subject to breaches\n\n**Combating digital dust:**\n\n- Regular digital decluttering sessions (monthly or quarterly)\n- Inbox zero and capture-process workflows\n- Account audits and deletion of unused services\n- Automated cleanup rules (auto-delete old downloads, auto-archive old emails)\n- Mindful digital consumption (save less, process more)\n- Treating digital hygiene as ongoing maintenance, not a one-time project\n\nDigital dust is the inevitable byproduct of living in a digital world. The goal isn't elimination but regular maintenance to prevent it from becoming overwhelming.",
