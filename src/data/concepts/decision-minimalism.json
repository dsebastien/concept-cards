    "summary": "Reducing daily decisions to preserve mental energy for what matters most.",
    "explanation": "Decision minimalism is the practice of deliberately reducing the number of decisions you make each day to preserve mental energy for important choices. The approach is based on: decision fatigue (choices deplete willpower), opportunity cost (mental energy spent on trivial decisions isn't available for important ones), and cognitive load (fewer decisions means clearer thinking). Tactics include: standardizing routine choices (same breakfast, work uniform), automating recurring decisions (subscriptions, scheduled tasks), using rules instead of case-by-case judgment, and batching similar decisions. Famous practitioners include: Steve Jobs (same outfit daily), Obama (limited clothing choices), and many entrepreneurs. Decision minimalism isn't about avoiding all decisions but about: being strategic about where to spend decision energy, creating systems for routine choices, and reserving cognitive resources for high-impact decisions. For knowledge workers, decision minimalism helps: reduce mental fatigue, improve decision quality for important choices, and create space for creative and strategic thinking.",
