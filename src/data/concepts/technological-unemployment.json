    "summary": "Job losses caused by technological change outpacing the economy's ability to create new employment opportunities.",
    "explanation": "Technological unemployment occurs when advances in technology eliminate jobs faster than new jobs are created to replace them. While technology has historically created more jobs than it destroyed, concerns about AI and automation have renewed debate about whether this pattern will continue.\n\n**Historical perspective**:\n\nThe term was popularized by economist John Maynard Keynes in 1930, who predicted that technological progress would eventually reduce the need for human labor. Throughout history, major technological shifts have caused significant labor displacement:\n\n- Agricultural mechanization moved workers from farms to factories\n- Industrial automation reduced manufacturing employment\n- Computerization transformed office work and eliminated many clerical jobs\n- Internet technologies disrupted retail, media, and many service industries\n\nIn each case, new industries and occupations eventually emerged, though transitions were often painful and prolonged.\n\n**The AI automation debate**:\n\nCurrent concerns center on whether AI represents a fundamental break from past patterns:\n\n**Arguments that 'this time is different'**:\n- AI can automate cognitive tasks, not just physical ones\n- The pace of change may exceed human adaptability\n- AI capabilities are expanding rapidly across domains\n- New jobs may require skills many displaced workers lack\n- The economics of human labor may change fundamentally\n\n**Arguments for continuity**:\n- Historical predictions of mass unemployment have not materialized\n- New technologies create new needs and new industries\n- Human labor has unique qualities AI cannot replicate\n- Implementation of automation faces practical barriers\n- Demand for human services may expand indefinitely\n\n**Jobs most at risk**:\n\n- Routine cognitive work (data entry, basic analysis)\n- Predictable physical labor (warehouse work, assembly)\n- Pattern-matching tasks (document review, image analysis)\n- Customer service with scripted interactions\n- Transportation (driving, delivery)\n\n**Jobs potentially more resilient**:\n\n- Complex physical tasks in unpredictable environments\n- Creative and strategic work requiring judgment\n- Interpersonal care and relationship-based services\n- Work requiring contextual understanding and common sense\n- Tasks involving accountability and responsibility\n\n**Policy responses**:\n\n- **Education and retraining**: Prepare workers for changing demands\n- **Social safety nets**: Support displaced workers during transitions\n- **Universal basic income**: Decouple income from employment\n- **Job guarantees**: Ensure employment availability\n- **Work sharing**: Distribute available work more broadly\n- **Automation taxes**: Slow displacement and fund transitions\n\nWhether AI causes mass unemployment or transforms work as past technologies did, the transition will require conscious management to minimize hardship and ensure broadly shared prosperity.",
