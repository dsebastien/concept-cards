    "summary": "Games played for the purpose of winning, with fixed rules and clear endpoints.",
    "explanation": "Finite games, as defined by philosopher James Carse in 'Finite and Infinite Games' (1986), are contests with known players, fixed rules, and agreed-upon objectives. They have clear beginnings and endings, and the purpose is to win - to bring the game to a close in your favor.\n\nKey characteristics of finite games:\n\n1. Known players: Participants are defined at the start\n2. Fixed rules: Rules are established and don't change during play\n3. Clear endpoint: There's a definite conclusion\n4. Winners and losers: Someone wins, others lose\n5. External rewards: Prizes, titles, recognition\n\nExamples of finite games:\n- Sports competitions (Super Bowl, Olympics)\n- Elections (one winner, defined endpoint)\n- School exams (pass/fail, grades)\n- Legal trials (verdict concludes the case)\n- Project deadlines (complete by date X)\n\nFinite games are appropriate and necessary in many contexts. They provide:\n- Clear goals and motivation\n- Measurable outcomes\n- Fair competition through consistent rules\n- Closure and resolution\n- Recognition of achievement\n\nProblems occur when finite thinking is applied to infinite contexts:\n- Treating business as a war to be won leads to ethical shortcuts\n- Viewing careers as races creates burnout\n- Approaching relationships as competitions damages trust\n- Optimizing for short-term wins sacrifices long-term viability\n\nThe wisdom lies in recognizing which type of game you're playing. Play finite games to win, but recognize when you're actually in an infinite game that requires a different mindset. Most meaningful endeavors - business, relationships, learning, health - are infinite games that require sustainable approaches rather than win-at-all-costs strategies.\n\nFor knowledge workers, understanding finite games helps: set clear project boundaries, compete effectively when appropriate, celebrate completions, and distinguish between contexts requiring finite versus infinite approaches.",
