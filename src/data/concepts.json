Unfinished tasks move to tomorrow's list. The power is in its simplicity - forced prioritization, single-tasking, and carrying forward unfinished work.

A small portion of inputs typically produces the majority of outputs. In productivity, 20% of your efforts likely produce 80% of your results. In PKM, a small percentage of your notes may provide most of your value. This principle helps prioritize: identify and focus on the vital few rather than the trivial many. Don't try to capture everything - focus on what matters most.",

Instead of deciding which items deserve attention, you identify what can be safely eliminated. This inverts the typical decision burden - everything that isn't eliminated gets processed. The approach is useful for inbox processing, content curation, and note cleanup. It often leads to faster processing because elimination decisions can be quicker than value judgments.",

In PKM, it manifests as tool-hopping - endlessly switching between note-taking apps, always convinced the next tool will solve all problems. This prevents developing deep fluency with any system. The antidote is commitment: pick a good-enough tool and stick with it long enough to develop real proficiency before evaluating alternatives.",

Instead of everyone thinking in different directions simultaneously, all participants 'wear' the same hat at the same time, focusing collectively on one type of thinking before moving to the next.

The challenge is that old patterns are deeply ingrained. PKM helps by making beliefs explicit so they can be examined and updated. Evergreen notes should evolve, and sometimes that means removing outdated content.",

It has limited capacity - typically 4-7 items - and information decays quickly without rehearsal. Working memory is the 'mental workspace' where thinking happens. PKM systems extend working memory by externalizing information, allowing you to offload details and free up mental space for higher-order thinking.

The method is both a structure (composed of an Inbox, Literature notes archive, and Permanent notes archive) and a process for capturing, exploring, storing, and organizing ideas. It puts focus on connecting ideas rather than accumulating isolated pieces of information, helping to build a deep Web of Knowledge that aids in research, writing, and idea development.",
